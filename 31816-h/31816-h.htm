<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>In preparing for publication the following sketch of
the famous Transylvania Medical Department and
its professors, I have placed in foot-notes, as far as
practicable, my own additions to the text, so as to avoid
making any radical change in my father's manuscript.</p>

<p>Portions of the history may seem fragmentary; some
of the lives of the professors may be incomplete; some,
no doubt, are insufficiently noticed, but this is easily
understood when it is considered that my father wrote
this narrative at irregular intervals of leisure in the years
from 1873 to 1878, when some of the professors were
still living; and that the writing was left by him in a
yet uncompleted state and lacking those finishing touches
which no other hand could so well give. In what I have
done I have striven for accuracy. My father's reminiscences
will have due weight as coming from one most
intimately associated with Transylvania and her medical
teachers&mdash;from the one colleague of all the brilliant company
who could best transcribe them. The notice of
Doctor Eberle I have copied from the <i>Transylvania
Journal of Medicine</i> of 1838, as the nearest I could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
to the estimation in which he was held in the Transylvania
School. The sketch of Doctor Bruce is gathered
mainly from obituaries by his colleagues. That of Doctor
Chipley&mdash;oftenest described, by those who knew him, as
nature's nobleman&mdash;was written by his daughter, Mrs.
Boykin Jones, in answer to my letter to her. I have
added a few words about Doctor Marshall, and Doctor
Skillman, "the beloved physician," the last survivor of
the Transylvania Medical Faculty. And I have given
as best I could a description of the last declining years
of Transylvania, with some account of the Medical Hall
and its ultimate fate. Any biography of Doctor Peter,
I fear, must be unsatisfactory unless written at length.
The brief summary of his life introductory to <i>The History
of Transylvania University</i>, published by The Filson Club
in 1896, was called "insufficient," "far too modest," etc.
Such the story of a life so long, so full, and so many-sided
must ever be unless a volume be devoted to it.
In what I now say of my father I feel, even more than I
did then, that I can not do justice. It is a mere itinerary
of a life-journey. The same thing is true in varying degree
of all the Transylvania professors, and I repeat here what
I said of the former <i>History of Transylvania</i>&mdash;that all
errors or faults must be ascribed to my own insufficiency
to cope with the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>Nevertheless, with all its shortcomings, this is a record
not unworthy of preservation, and while biographers
point us to the fact that in the United States Senate
there sat at one and the same time no fewer than <i>eight</i>
graduates of Transylvania University, including Jefferson
Davis, afterward President of the Southern Confederacy,
the student of these pages will remark that Transylvania's
Medical Department had already won as abundant
laurels in the field of science.</p>

<p>My grateful acknowledgments are due, first and for
many kindnesses, to our invaluable President, Colonel
Reuben T. Durrett, through whose unfailing interest,
literary judgment, and tactful encouragement so many
gems of Kentucky history have been preserved which
otherwise had perished, and to the many friends of old
Transylvania who have bid me Godspeed in my undertaking.
I am indebted to Mrs. Thomas H. Clay for
letters and documents bearing upon my subject; to Miss
Mary Mason Brown for a copy of Jouett's admirable
portrait of Doctor Brown which hangs in the old Brown
homestead at Frankfort; to Mrs. Lawrence Dade Fitzhugh
for data and the permission to use the beautiful
portrait by Jouett of her ancestor, Doctor Richardson;
to Mrs. Sallie Overton Bullock for the picture of Doctor
Overton; to Mrs. Anderson Berry for the picture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
Doctor Cooke; to Mr. William Short, of Louisville, for
valuable suggestions and the fine likeness of Doctor
Short; and to Doctor A. M. Peter for some of the illustrations.
The several descendants of Doctor Ridgely to
whom I applied have, without exception, aided me most
courteously and patiently in my search for a picture of
Doctor Ridgely: a search which I abandoned with the
utmost reluctance and with the feeling that his portrait,
could I have found it, must have adorned this history
as his life had adorned the times to which it belonged,
and therefore be sadly missed from its place with Doctor
Brown. To Doctor John W. Whitney, who was prosector
of Surgery and Anatomy in the Transylvania
Medical School in 1854&ndash;55, and is now the sole surviving
representative of that school, I am indebted for a number
of facts and suggestions.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The late Doctor Robert Peter, one of the most distinguished
analytical chemists of his times, was a
member of the Medical Faculty of Transylvania University
from 1833 to the time of the dissolution of that institution,
and afterward occupied chairs in the different
colleges into which Transylvania was merged. He was
one of the most active of the professors, and did as much
as any one else to raise the university to the lofty heights
it attained as a school of literature, law, and medicine.
It occurred to him after the merger of the Transylvania
into the Kentucky University that an institution which
had led the way and done so much for literature, law,
and medicine should not be permitted to vanish and
leave nothing but a name and memory behind. He,
therefore, went to work, after the weight of years was
gathering fast upon him, to write the history of Transylvania
University, and got his work almost finished in
1894, when death, which alone could have arrested him
in his undertaking, relieved him of the task at the age
of eighty-nine. His daughter, Miss Johanna Peter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
with filial affection worthy of so excellent a father, and
public spirit equal to the occasion, rightly estimating so
good a work if it should be published and put into the
hands of the public, undertook to prepare his manuscripts
for publication. One of these manuscripts prepared
by her embraced the literary department of Transylvania,
and was published by The Filson Club in 1896
as its eleventh publication. When this publication was
made, it was intimated, if not promised, that it would
be followed in the near future by one of the medical department.
Miss Peter, therefore, prepared this second
manuscript of her father for publication, and The Filson
Club now presents it in the pages which follow as the
twentieth number in its regular annual series.</p>

<p>The medical department of the Transylvania University
no longer exists. Indeed, nothing of the Transylvania
University exists except its name. Its learned
professors have gone the way of all flesh. The last one
of them recently went down to his grave. Its buildings
have been swept away by fire or have passed to other
institutions with its library and apparatus. Yet all of
this renowned University has not passed away. Its
fame yet lives, and will not perish while the memory of
the living holds sacred the good deeds of predecessors.
The distinguished professors made Transylvania University<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
famous, and made history at the same time, and
they themselves are now entitled to a place in history.
It is the purpose of The Filson Club, by this publication,
to assist in securing for them the place they deserve in
the memory of mankind. Doctor Peter, the author,
was the fittest of men to sketch these professors and to
present life pictures of them. His work, however, if it
had remained in manuscript, as he left it, would have
been seen but by few, and could have done but little
good. In this twentieth publication of The Filson Club,
the manuscript will make its way to many and present
them with likenesses of those who devoted their lives to
instructing the young of our land in the art of administering
to the sick and afflicted. The author knew all of
his contemporary professors, and the likeness which he
has given of some of them will be the ones by which they
will be known in after years. Pen pictures are sometimes
as efficient as likenesses in oil, and the characteristic of
Doctor Peter's pictures is fidelity so executed that they
seem to be the originals standing in life before us. In a
work like this the essence of its history is biographic,
and Doctor Peter has made his work to consist chiefly
of biographical sketches of those who made Transylvania
University what it was. He gives the leading facts in
the life of each of the professors he sketches, and enumerates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
the other colleges in which they occupied chairs,
and gives the titles of the works they published either
in book form or magazine articles. He omits nothing in
the sketch that is necessary in forming a just idea of the
character portrayed.</p>

<p>In the long career of Transylvania University she did
not fail to make enemies, but she made more friends
than enemies to remember her. A few of the living
students and the many descendants of the deceased professors
and graduates now scattered broadcast over the
land will be glad to read what is here said of old Transylvania,
and the work will thus be widely known and read.
All who see it will be thankful to Doctor Peter for his
manuscript, and to Miss Johanna Peter for preparing it
for the press, and to The Filson Club for publishing it.</p>

<p>There is in our nature something like the love of the
relic which makes us revere the memory of Transylvania
University. Early in the year 1799 a medical department
was attached to this University which was the first
medical college in the great Mississippi Valley and the
second in the whole United States. The medical department
of the University of Pennsylvania antedated it,
but it antedated all others afterward established in any
part of our vast domain. We can not, like our English
cousins, go back along the pathway of centuries to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
colleges of Oxford and Cambridge and revere them for
their age; we have nothing in our new country that partakes
of such age. We are a young people in a young
country, and our Transylvania Medical College was old
enough from our standpoint to be crowned with hoary
years. We revere it as the first medical college on this
side of the Alleghanies. We revere it for the efforts it
made to prepare our young physicians to cope with the
diseases that afflicted our people. We revere it for the
good name it gave our State in the fame it acquired.
We revere it for the success of Professor Brown in introducing
vaccination in advance of its discoverer, for the
brilliant and numerous operations in lithotomy by Professor
Dudley, and for the noble efforts of others of its
professors in prolonging human life and mitigating its
pains. What it did in the day of its glory is set forth
in the pages which follow, and he who reads them will
hardly doubt that the medical department of Transylvania
University is worthy of the record here made for it.</p>

<h2>MEDICAL DEPARTMENT</h2>
<h5>OF</h5>
<h2>TRANSYLVANIA UNIVERSITY</h2>

<p>The history of medicine and of the earliest medical
men in Kentucky clusters around the name of
<span class="smcap">Transylvania University</span>.</p>

<p>The State of Virginia, in 1780&mdash;when "Kan-tuck-ee"
or "Kentuckee," as this country was then called, was
only a little-explored portion of that State&mdash;placed eight
thousand acres of escheated lands within that county
into the hands of thirteen trustees "for the purposes of
a public school or <i>seminary of learning</i>," that they "might
at a future day be a valuable fund for the maintenance
and education of youth; it being the interest of this
Commonwealth always to promote and encourage every
design which might tend to the improvement of the mind
and the diffusion of knowledge, even amongst the most
remote citizens, whose situation a barbarous neighborhood
and a savage intercourse might otherwise render
unfriendly to science."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>Three years thereafter (1783), when Kentucky had
become a <i>district</i> of Virginia, the General Assembly, by a
new amendatory Act, re-endowed this "public school"
with twelve thousand acres more of escheated lands and
gave to it all the privileges, powers, and immunities of
"any college or university in the State," under the name
of "<i>Transylvania Seminary</i>."</p>

<p>In the wild and sparsely settled country this seminary
began a feeble existence under the special fostering care
and patronage of the Presbyterians, who were then a
leading religious body, aided by individual subscriptions
and by additional State endowments.</p>

<p>The Reverend James Mitchel, a Presbyterian minister,
was its first "<i>Grammar Master</i>," in 1785. In 1789
it was placed under the charge of Mr. Isaac Wilson and
located in Lexington, with no more than thirteen pupils
all told. The Reverend James Moore, educated for the
Presbyterian ministry but subsequently an Episcopalian
and first Rector of Christ Church, Lexington, was
appointed "Director," or the first acting President of
the Transylvania Seminary, in 1791.<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He taught in his
own house for want of a proper seminary building, with
the aid of a small library and collection of philosophical
apparatus. This library and apparatus had been donated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
by the Reverend John Todd, of Virginia, who, with other
influential Presbyterians, had been mainly instrumental
in procuring the charters and endowments from the General
Assembly of Virginia.</p>

<p>The offer of a lot of ground in the town of Lexington<a name="FNanchor_2_14" id="FNanchor_2_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_14" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
to the trustees of <i>Transylvania Seminary</i>, by a company
of gentlemen calling themselves the "<i>Transylvania Land
Company</i>," induced the trustees to permanently locate
the seminary in that place in 1793. On that lot the
first school and college buildings were placed, and on it
was afterward erected the more commodious <i>University</i>
edifice in which taught the learned and celebrated President,
Doctor Horace Holley. This first <i>University</i> building
was destroyed by fire May 9, 1829. In later years
(1879) this old "College lot" was beautified and improved
by tree-planting and otherwise by liberal citizens of Lexington,
moved by the efforts of Mr. H. H. Gratz, and
designated first "Centennial Park,"<a name="FNanchor_3_15" id="FNanchor_3_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_15" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and afterward
"Gratz Park," in honor of Benjamin Gratz, being not
now utilized for special educational purposes.</p>

<p>With limited success the first "<i>Director</i> of Transylvania
Seminary" taught in Lexington until 1794, when
he was superseded by the election by the Board of Trustees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of Mr. Harry Toulmin as first President of the
Seminary.</p>

<p>This gentleman, a learned Unitarian minister of the
school of Doctor Priestly, and a native of England,
resigned the Presidency in 1796, and was Secretary of
State of Kentucky under Governor Garrard. (See <i>Collins'
History of Kentucky</i>, volume 2, page 184.)</p>

<p>Intense feeling at the election of Mr. Toulmin on the
part of the leading Presbyterians, who claimed the Seminary
as their own peculiar institution, caused them to
obtain in 1796 a charter from the Legislature of Kentucky&mdash;now
a State&mdash;for a new institution of learning
which they could more exclusively control. This was
the "Kentucky Academy," of which the Reverend James
Blythe, of their communion, was made President.<a name="FNanchor_4_16" id="FNanchor_4_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_16" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>On the establishment of the <i>Kentucky Academy</i> by the
dissatisfied Presbyterians in 1796, an active rivalry between
that school and Transylvania Seminary operated to the
injury of both institutions as well as to the cause of education
in general. Therefore, after two years of separate
existence these two institutions, with the consent of the
trustees of both, were united in 1798 by Act of the General
Assembly of Kentucky into one, "for the promotion
of public good and learning," under the title of <i>Transylvania
University</i>. The consolidation was made under the
original laws which governed the Transylvania Seminary
as enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Transylvania University.</span></h4>

<p>Under the act of consolidation of December 22, 1798,
this University was organized by the appointment of
Reverend James Moore, of the Episcopal Church, as first
acting President, with a corps of professors. And now,
<i>for the first time</i> in the Mississippi Valley, was the effort
made to establish a <i>medical college</i>.</p>

<p>Early in 1799, at the first meeting of the trustees of
the new Transylvania University,<a name="FNanchor_5_17" id="FNanchor_5_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_17" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> they instituted "The
<i>Medical Department</i>" or <i>College</i> of Transylvania&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
subsequently became so prosperous and so celebrated&mdash;by
the appointment of Doctor Samuel Brown as Professor
of Chemistry, Anatomy, and Surgery, and Doctor Frederick
Ridgely as Professor of Materia Medica, Midwifery,
and Practice of Physic. Doctor Brown qualified as Professor
October 26, 1799, and Doctor Ridgely the following
November.</p>

<p>Doctor Brown was authorized by the Board to import
books and other means of instruction for the use of the
medical professors to the amount of five hundred dollars<a name="FNanchor_6_18" id="FNanchor_6_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_18" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;a
considerable sum in those days&mdash;and he and his
colleague were made salaried officers of the University.</p>

<p>A Law College was also organized at this time in the

<h4><span class="smcap">Doctor Samuel Brown,</span></h4>

<p>The first Medical Professor of Transylvania University
and of the great Western country, was born in Augusta,
or Rockbridge County, Virginia, January 30, 1769, and
died near Huntsville, Alabama, at the residence of Colonel
Thomas G. Percy, January 12, 1830. He was the son of
Reverend John Brown, a Presbyterian minister of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
learning and piety, and Margaret Preston&mdash;a woman of
remarkable energy of character and vigor of mind&mdash;second
daughter of John Preston and Elizabeth Patton.<a name="FNanchor_7_19" id="FNanchor_7_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_19" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
He was the third of four distinguished brothers&mdash;Honorable
John Brown, Honorable James Brown, Doctor Samuel
Brown, and Doctor Preston Brown.</p>

<p>After graduating at Carlisle College, Pennsylvania,
where he had been sent by his elder brother, he studied
medicine for two years in Edinburgh, Scotland. Doctor
Hosack, of New York, and Doctor E. McDowell, of Danville,
Kentucky, were of the same class. Returning to
the United States, he commenced practice in Bladensburg,
but soon removed to Lexington, Kentucky, where
he was made Professor of Chemistry, Anatomy, and Surgery
in Transylvania University in 1799, as above stated.
In 1806, he removed to Fort Adams, Mississippi, where he
married Miss Percy, of Alabama.<a name="FNanchor_8_20" id="FNanchor_8_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_20" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Afterward returning
to Lexington he was re-appointed in 1819 to a chair in
the Medical Department of Transylvania, that of Theory
and Practice. Here he was a distinguished colleague of
Professors B. W. Dudley, Charles Caldwell, Daniel Drake,
William Richardson, and James Blythe until 1825, when
he finally left Kentucky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Doctor Brown was a man of fine personal appearance
and manners; an accomplished scholar, gifted with a
natural eloquence and humor that made him one of the
most fascinating lecturers of his day. Learned in many
branches, he was an enthusiast in his own profession,
scrupulous in regard to etiquette and exceedingly benevolent
and liberal of his time and services to the poor. Although
active in scientific pursuits he left no extensive
work, and but a few detached writings to perpetuate his
fame.</p>

    <p class="caption">DOCTOR SAMUEL BROWN.<br />From Jouett's Portrait at Frankfort.</p>
</div>

<p>His name appears among those of the contributors to
the <i>American Philosophical Transactions</i>, and to the
medical and scientific periodicals of the day, both in
this country and in Europe. In those <i>Transactions</i> and
in <i>Bruce's Journal of Mineralogy</i>, etc., he described a
remarkably large nitre cavern on Crooked Creek in Madison
County (now Rockcastle County), Kentucky. In this
and in a subsequent communication in Volume I of <i>Silliman's
Journal</i> he described the process of nitre manufacture
in caves, and gave the best theory of its formation,
according to the science of the day. In various
other journals he described several interesting cases which
occurred in his own practice, and in the renowned <i>Medical
Logic</i>, by the distinguished Gilbert Blane, of London,
Doctor Samuel Brown, of Lexington, is quoted as authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
for a certain scientific fact. "To him we are indebted
for the first introduction in the West of the prophylactic
use of the cow-pox. As early as 1802 he had vaccinated
upwards of five hundred persons, when in New York and
Philadelphia physicians were only just making their first
experimental attempts. The virus he used was taken
from its original source, the teats of the cow, and used in
Lexington even before Jenner could gain the confidence
of the people of his own country."<a name="FNanchor_9_21" id="FNanchor_9_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_21" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>A curious anecdote, illustrating <i>progress</i>, was told of
Doctor Samuel Brown by his nephew, the late Orlando
Brown, Esquire, of Frankfort, in a letter to the present
writer:</p>

<p>"I remember once when talking of calomel, he said he
never would forget the first dose of it he gave a patient.
It was looked upon as 'the Hercules,' and he used it
accordingly. The case was desperate and he resolved to
venture upon calomel and give a <i>strong dose</i>. He accordingly
weighed out with scrupulous accuracy <i>four grains</i>&mdash;gave
it to his patient, <i>and sat up all night to watch its effects</i>.
The man got well and the Doctor afterwards used calomel
more freely."</p>

<p>What would he have thought of the heaping tablespoonful
doses&mdash;quickly repeated <i>pro re nata</i>&mdash;or the <i>pound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
calomel</i> taken in a day&mdash;and survived&mdash;which characterized
the cholera treatment of one of the later Professors
of Transylvania Medical School?</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Doctor Frederick Ridgely,</span></h4>

<p>Of a well-known family in Maryland,<a name="FNanchor_10_22" id="FNanchor_10_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_22" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and one of the
most celebrated of the early physicians of the West,
studied medicine in Delaware, and attended medical
lectures in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>He was appointed Surgeon to a rifle corps in Virginia
when only nineteen years of age, and served in different
positions as Surgeon throughout the Revolutionary War.
He came to Kentucky in 1790, was Surgeon-General in
General Wayne's army in 1794, and after that decisive
campaign was ended returned to Kentucky in 1799 and
was made Professor of Materia Medica, Midwifery, and
the Practice of Physic in the same year in the Medical
Department of Transylvania University at the first organization
of this department.</p>

<p>Widely known as a successful practitioner and a gentleman
of great benevolence, disinterestedness, and affability,
he was also one of the medical preceptors of Kentucky's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
distinguished surgeon, Benjamin W. Dudley, and
for many years gave active support to Transylvania University
as a member of the Board of Trustees. In 1799&ndash;1800,
he delivered to the small class of medical students
then in attendance a course of public instruction which
did him much credit&mdash;a fact of peculiar interest, "as it
proves him to have been," with his able colleague, Doctor
Samuel Brown, "<i>the first who taught medicine by lecture in
Western America</i>." He died at the age of sixty-eight at
Dayton, Ohio, December 21, 1824.</p>

<p>These first medical professors in Transylvania University
were no doubt the first in the promotion of medical
education in the West. Medical and Law societies were
soon established and were in active operation&mdash;as we
learn from the columns of the <i>Kentucky Gazette</i>, published
at the time. How many pupils they attracted and taught
we can not now definitely ascertain.</p>

<p>In 1801, the meager existing records of the University
show a reorganization, in which the Reverend James
Moore&mdash;who had been replaced in 1799 by a Presbyterian
clergyman, the Reverend James Welsh&mdash;was restored
to the Presidency. "Doctor Frederick Ridgely was made
Professor of Medicine, and Doctor Walter Warfield was
made Professor of Midwifery, in addition to Doctor
Samuel Brown." Doctor Warfield, a physician of Lexington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
did not long occupy this chair, and appears not
to have lectured in it.</p>

<p>In 1804, the Reverend James Blythe, D. D., of the
Presbyterian church, who had been President of <i>Kentucky
Academy</i>, was made acting President of <i>Transylvania
University</i>, which position he held until 1816. He
was subsequently, in 1817, under Doctor Holley's administration,
appointed Professor of Chemistry, etc., in the
Medical Department. This position he retained until, in
1831, he accepted the Presidency of Hanover College,
Indiana.</p>

<p>Doctor Blythe died in 1842, aged seventy-seven, having
devoted his life mainly to religion; having been one
of the pioneers of the Presbyterian church in Kentucky.
He made no distinguished reputation as a chemical professor
in the Medical School, for chemistry in those days
had few advocates, but he did good service in the University
as a teacher of what was called "Natural Philosophy"
in early times.</p>

<p><i>The Medical College of Transylvania University</i> seems
not to have attracted many students in this early period
of its history, nor were its means of instruction or its
organization complete.</p>

<p>In 1805, Doctor James Fishback, D. D., was made
Professor of the Theory and Practice of Physic in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
department.<a name="FNanchor_11_23" id="FNanchor_11_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_23" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He was characterized as an eloquent,
learned, though erratic divine; an able writer; a physician
in good practice; an influential lawyer, and an
upright man. He was the son of Jacob Fishback,<a name="FNanchor_12_24" id="FNanchor_12_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_24" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> who
came to Kentucky from Virginia in 1783.</p>

<p>He resigned this chair in 1806, having given lectures
to such small medical classes as were present. In 1808,
he was elected Representative to the General Assembly
of Kentucky. In 1813, he published <i>The Philosophy of
the Mind in Respect to Religion</i>, and, in 1834, <i>Essays
and Dialogues on the Powers and Susceptibilities of the
Human Mind to Religion</i>. He was also preceptor in
medicine, and for a time partner in the practice, of the
celebrated surgeon, Benjamin W. Dudley. He died at
an advanced age in 1854.</p>

<p>An effort was again made to organize a full Faculty
and establish a medical school in Transylvania University
in the year 1809, when Doctor Benjamin W. Dudley
was appointed to the chair of Anatomy and Physiology,
Doctor Elisha Warfield to Surgery and Obstetrics, Joseph
Buchanan, A. M., to the Institutes of Medicine, and
Doctor James Overton to Materia Medica and Botany.<a name="FNanchor_13_25" id="FNanchor_13_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_25" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
But Doctor Warfield resigned in the same year, and
Doctor Buchanan in 1810. The late Lewis Rogers, M. D.,
of Louisville, thus mentioned Doctor Buchanan in his
inaugural address as President of the Kentucky State
Medical Society in 1873: "He died in Louisville in 1829:
and I call up from the memories of my boyhood with
great distinctness his slender form, massive head, and
thoughtful, intellectual face. He was a man of great
and varied powers of mind. He was a mechanical, medical,
and political philosopher. His 'spiral' steam-boiler&mdash;the
prototype of the exploding and exploded tubular
boiler&mdash;and his steam land-carriage were among the
wonders of the day. As a physician his papers attracted
distinguished notice from the medical <i>savants</i> of Philadelphia,
then the center of medical science."</p>

<p>As a political writer he ably discussed the most weighty
problems of the times, he being editor of the <i>Louisville
Focus</i>. Want of concentration of his wonderful mind
prevented him from becoming eminent in medicine as in
other pursuits which divided his mental powers.<a name="FNanchor_14_26" id="FNanchor_14_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_26" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>No systematic medical instruction seems to have
resulted from this imperfect organization of the Medical
School in 1809, although occasional lectures may have
been delivered and private instruction given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>Doctor Dudley, after having graduated in medicine
in the University of Pennsylvania, visited Europe in
1810, spending four years in Paris and London in the
arduous pursuit of medical and surgical information and
experience under the celebrated teachers of that day.
Returning then to Lexington he began a career as a practical
surgeon and teacher, in which his name became distinguished
throughout the civilized world.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Doctor Benjamin Winslow Dudley</span></h4>

<p>Was born in Spottsylvania County, Virginia, April 12,
1785. His father, a leading Baptist minister in Kentucky,
Ambrose Dudley, had commanded a company in
the Revolutionary War, and removed to the neighborhood
of Lexington, Kentucky, when his son Benjamin was
little more than a year old, and to that city in 1797.
Here, reared with such tuition as the schools of the day
and the country afforded, Benjamin was placed while
yet very young under the medical tutelage of Doctor
Frederick Ridgely, then an eminent physician in large
practice in Lexington, under whose instruction his ardent
taste for medical knowledge was largely gratified. In
the autumn of 1804 he went to the Medical Department
of the University of Pennsylvania, and was there fellow-student
with Daniel Drake, John Esten Cooke, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
William H. Richardson, his subsequent colleagues in the
Medical Department of Transylvania University.</p>

<p>Returning to Lexington at the close of the medical
lectures at Philadelphia, he engaged in the practice of
physic and surgery with Doctor Fishback during the
spring and summer months of 1805. He returned to the
Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania
in the fall, receiving the degree of Doctor of Medicine
from that institution March, 1806, just two weeks before
he was twenty-one years of age.</p>

<p>Desirous of perfecting his medical education in Europe,
after a few years' further practice in Lexington he
descended the Ohio River on a flatboat to New Orleans
in 1810, just one year before the first experimental steamboat
was launched upon those waters. At New Orleans
he purchased a cargo of flour and sailed on a prosperous
voyage to Gibraltar, and after advantageously disposing
of his cargo at that place and at Lisbon, he made his
way through Spain to Paris. After four years spent in
Europe zealously and industriously employing all the
great facilities of the hospitals, dissecting-rooms, and
eminent instructors of Paris and London, and after traveling
six months in Italy and Switzerland, he finally returned
to Lexington in the summer of 1814, conscious of innate
powers and ardently devoted to his profession.</p>

    <p class="caption">DOCTOR BENJAMIN W. DUDLEY.<br />From a Portrait by Jouett owned by Mrs. Robert Peter.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Professor Dudley continued to lecture until 1850, when
he resigned and was appointed Professor Emeritus.
Doctor James M. Bush succeeded him in the chair of
Anatomy, and Dudley's nephew, Ethelbert L. Dudley,
took that of Surgery, which he filled with great success.</p>

<p>A schedule of the succession of the Professors of this
Medical School will best illustrate the changes which
occurred since 1819. (See Schedule A.)</p>

<p>Professor B. W. Dudley remained in the regular performance
of the duties of his double chair&mdash;Anatomy
and Surgery<a name="FNanchor_15_27" id="FNanchor_15_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_27" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;with the able assistance of Doctor J. M.
Bush, until 1844, when Doctor Bush was regularly
appointed Professor of Anatomy. Doctor Dudley, as
above mentioned, retained the chair of Surgery until
1850. In that year the Medical Faculty intermitted the
winter session in Lexington, with the consent of the Trustees,
in order to establish the "<i>Kentucky School of Medicine</i>"
in Louisville as a winter school, retaining the Transylvania
Medical College as a summer school. Doctor
Dudley's last course of lectures was delivered in the session
of 1849&ndash;50.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the resignation of his professorship,
he withdrew from his extensive practice and retired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to his beautiful suburban residence, "Fairlawn," in the
vicinity of Lexington.<a name="FNanchor_16_28" id="FNanchor_16_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_28" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> His death occurred in Lexington
on the twentieth of January, 1870, in the eighty-fifth
year of his age.</p>

<p>Doctor Dudley was an earnest and laborious practical
man. His whole time and energies were devoted to his
profession, in which, like the celebrated John Hunter&mdash;the
one of his early preceptors Dudley most admired&mdash;he
sought instruction in the book of nature&mdash;in his practice&mdash;rather
than in the written archives of science.</p>

<p>As a teacher and lecturer he was admirably clear and
impressive. While no attempt at eloquence was ever
made by him, and no early training or later readings in
the classics gave ornament to his style, his terse and
impressive sentences, as they were delivered apparently
without the slightest effort or premeditation as also
without hesitation or interruption, were the embodiment
of the ideas to be conveyed, in the most lucid and
concise language. It seemed impossible to use fewer or
more appropriate words to convey to the least appreciative
student the subject to be taught.</p>

<p>This, with his great practical skill as a surgeon, his
minute and ready knowledge, his great experience, his
unequaled success in his numerous operations, his suavity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and dignity of manner, the magnanimity and liberality
of his character, and his eminent devotedness to his profession,
made his students most earnest admirers and
followers and aided greatly in the establishment and
maintenance of our Medical College.</p>

<p>Although possessed of the firmest nerves, so that his
hand never faltered in the severest operation,<a name="FNanchor_17_29" id="FNanchor_17_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_29" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> his sensibility
was so keen that he sometimes suffered from
nervous prostration after the strain was over. Many of
his pupils no doubt recollect with what feeling&mdash;manifested
even by tears&mdash;he recited the sufferings and dangers
of a patient of his who was the subject of obstinate
secondary hemorrhage.</p>

<p>It was as a practical surgeon that Doctor Dudley
justly attained a world-wide reputation, and especially
as a successful operator in lithotomy. This operation
he performed two hundred and twenty-five times, without
losing a single patient until after his one hundredth operation,
losing in the whole of his operations only about
two per cent. So celebrated had he become for this
operation as early as 1827 that the <i>Kentucky Gazette</i>
for April 11, of that year, records that he operated three
times for stone in one day.</p>

<p>He always performed the lateral operation with the
gorget, and never until by previous preparation&mdash;by diet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and medicine&mdash;he had brought the system of his patient
to a proper state.<a name="FNanchor_18_30" id="FNanchor_18_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_30" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Then, with good nursing under his immediate direction
in wholesome private lodging, the incision healed up
by the first intention. Although the stone may have
been so large that much effort was required to withdraw
it through the incision&mdash;sometimes even attended with
laceration&mdash;the patient was on his feet again in a surprisingly
short period of time. The Doctor justly attached
great importance to the preliminary constitutional preparation
of his surgical patients.</p>

<p>A notice of two of his earliest operations of this kind
is given in the <i>Kentucky Gazette</i> for Saturday, November
19, 1817. The one&mdash;the first he performed in Lexington&mdash;on
Mr. S. Owen, of that place, and the other,
"some time ago," on a little boy in Paris, Kentucky,
which, according to Doctor C. C. Graham&mdash;who was his
pupil at that time&mdash;was the first operation for stone
performed by Doctor Dudley. He never used lithotrity
or seemed to approve of that operation.</p>

<p>Another surgical specialty was his great use of judicious
and regulated pressure by means of the roller
bandage in the cure of abscesses, in the control of inflammation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
in the treatment of fractures, aneurisms, etc.
No surgeon probably ever used it so extensively or so
successfully. Few, even of his pupils, seemed to be able
to apply it with the skill and judgment which characterized
their preceptor.</p>

<p>He was also an earnest advocate of the patient use of
hot water&mdash;as hot as could be borne&mdash;in the control of
inflammation. Where other surgeons resorted to poultices
he applied hot water.</p>

<p>He was not ready with his pen; because, probably,
of early neglect in the practice of composition. What
he wrote was mostly at the urgent solicitation of his
colleagues, and for the columns of <i>The Transylvania
Journal of Medicine</i>, a quarterly which first appeared in
Lexington February, 1828.<a name="FNanchor_19_31" id="FNanchor_19_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_31" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It was then edited by his
colleagues, Professors Cooke and Short; subsequently by
Professor Yandell, then by Professor Peter, more lately by
Professor T. D. Mitchell, and lastly by Professor Ethelbert
L. Dudley.</p>

<p>In the first volume of this Journal appeared Doctor
Dudley's first paper, a most remarkable article, showing
by cases in his practice that epilepsy may be caused by
pressure on the brain, the consequence of fracture of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
skull, and, as demonstrated by five successive operations,
might be cured by trephining, a fact and experience in
surgery then entirely new, for which Doctor Dudley is
entitled to the honor of discovery and demonstration.</p>

<p>In the same paper is communicated a novel and successful
method of treatment of <i>fungus cerebri</i>, by means
of dried sponge compresses. Doctor Dudley stated that
by this means he had cured <i>fungus cerebri</i> within the
space of five days.</p>

<p>In a second paper, in the next number of this volume,
he gives an original and successful operation for hydrocele.
In the fourth number he began an extensive article on his
peculiar uses of the roller bandage in gunshot wounds,
fractures, etc., which he continued through several volumes
of the Journal. In the second volume he had given
an interesting article on the use of the roller bandage
in the treatment of ulcers, contusions, lacerations, effusions,
etc. In the fifth volume he continued his remarks
on epilepsy as treated by the trephine. In volume sixth
he published a record of his experience in the treatment
of Asiatic cholera in Lexington. In the ninth he continued
his observations on the bandage and its very successful
application in the treatment of fractures. A
most interesting and valuable article on <i>Calculous
Diseases</i> from his pen appeared in the same volume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
illustrating not only his great practical skill but his
courage and quick and clear judgment in cases of emergency.
Volumes ten and twelve contained reports of his
operations in lithotomy; volume eleven, a paper on
<i>Fractures and Calculous Diseases</i>.</p>

<p>In the elegant and generally correct Memoir of
Doctor Benjamin W. Dudley, published by the late
Lunsford P. Yandell, M. D., in the <i>American Practitioner</i>,
1870, these are stated to be the only writings
of our late distinguished surgeon; but Doctor Dudley
subsequently published three elaborate and highly valuable
surgical papers, to wit:</p>

<p>1. <i>On the Treatment of Aneurism</i>, published in the
<i>Transylvania Journal of Medicine</i>, edited by Professor
Ethelbert L. Dudley, July, 1849.</p>

<p>2. <i>On the Treatment of Gunshot Wounds.</i> Ibid., December,
1849.</p>

<p>3. <i>On the Treatment of Fractures by the Roller Bandage.</i>
Ibid., 1850.</p>

<p>This journal was a bi-weekly publication, the successor
of the old <i>Transylvania Medical Journal</i> above mentioned.</p>

<p>These were the latest productions of Doctor B. W.
Dudley. Engaged as he continually was in a daily round
of engrossing surgical and medical practice, lecturing
twice a day in the Medical School during its sessions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
there was left to him but little time for the record or
promulgation of his ample experience by his pen.</p>

<p>As a medical practitioner also he was original. He
was among the first to discard the lancet in his treatment
of disease. He used instead small doses of
tartar emetic, or more recently, of ipecacuanha frequently
repeated, with low diet; or cholagogue purgatives
combined with ipecacuanha, etc. He confined
himself to but few medicines, but in the application
of these, and of diet and regimen, his clear and
correct judgment was usually apparent. Polypharmacy
he despised. New remedies were looked upon by him
with incredulity and suspicion. Quinine, iodine, and
other novelties in his time never were accorded approbation
by him.</p>

<p>As a man and a citizen he was eminently liberal,
charitable, magnanimous, public-spirited, and energetic.
He bound his friends to him with the strongest ties and
treated his hostile enemies&mdash;who were few&mdash;with a cordial
hatred. His sense of honor and personal dignity
was very delicate and high. No one so deeply despised
a mean action. No one so readily forgave an injury
which was confessed.</p>

<p>An exemplification of his character was given in
1817&ndash;18. A difficulty having originated between himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and Doctor Drake, in relation to the resignation of
the latter and some matters connected with a post-mortem
examination of an Irishman who had been killed
in a quarrel, sharp pamphlets passed between them and
a challenge to mortal combat from Dudley to Drake,
which the latter declined, but which was vicariously
accepted by his next friend, Doctor William H. Richardson.
A duel resulted in which, at the first fire, Richardson
was seriously wounded in the groin by the ball
of Dudley, severing the inguinal artery. Richardson
would have speedily bled to death&mdash;as it could not be
controlled by the tourniquet&mdash;but for the ready skill
and magnanimity of Dudley. He immediately asked
permission of his adversary to arrest the hemorrhage,
and by the pressure with his thumb over the ilium gave
time for the application of the ligature by the surgeon
of Richardson&mdash;thus converting his deadly antagonist
into a lifelong friend.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Doctor Dudley had contributed tens
of thousands to public improvement and to private
charities, and never regularly kept accounts against his
patients, he acquired a considerable fortune. His latter
days were passed in the society of his children and grandchildren
in the household of his son, the late William A.
Dudley, surrounded by all the comforts which a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
competency and a devoted family could provide. Thus,
in the quiet of domestic retirement, passed away the
last days of a most active and eminently useful and distinguished
life.<a name="FNanchor_20_32" id="FNanchor_20_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_32" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The annals of the earlier efforts to establish medical
education and a medical college in connection with Transylvania
University&mdash;the first in the whole West and
the second in the United States&mdash;are meager and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>As already stated, the first Medical Professors in this
University&mdash;Doctors Samuel Brown and Frederick
Ridgely (1799)&mdash;no doubt taught and lectured occasionally
to such students as were present. The files of
the old <i>Kentucky Gazette</i> show that Doctor James Fishback,
who was unanimously appointed to the chair of
Theory and Practice of Medicine in Transylvania in 1805,
advertised to lecture, and did probably lecture on these
subjects. But he resigned in 1806. Doctor James
Overton, who had been appointed to the chair of Materia
Medica and Botany in 1809, said in his letter of acceptance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
(on the occasion of his reappointment in the reorganization
of the Medical Faculty in 1817) that he "had
engaged for some time in giving lectures on Theory and
Practice in this town," etc.</p>

<p>According to the best recollection of the late Doctor
Coleman Rogers&mdash;for a long time before his death a resident
in Louisville&mdash;the Medical College of Transylvania
University was reorganized in 1815 by the appointment
of the following Faculty:</p>

<p>Doctor Benjamin W. Dudley, Professor of Anatomy
and Surgery.</p>

<p>Doctor Coleman Rogers, adjunct to this chair.</p>

<p>Doctor James Overton, Theory and Practice.</p>

<p>Doctor William H. Richardson, Obstetrics, etc.</p>

<p>Doctor Thomas Cooper (Judge Cooper), of Pennsylvania,
to the chair of Chemistry, Mineralogy, etc.</p>

<p>Doctor James Blythe, then acting President of the
University, was to give chemical instruction. Doctor
Cooper and Doctor Rogers did not accept this appointment.
According to Doctor Rogers' recollection a regular
course of lectures was not delivered by this Faculty,
although Doctors Dudley and Overton probably both
lectured or taught "as they previously had done."<a name="FNanchor_21_33" id="FNanchor_21_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_33" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>Doctor Dudley's own recollection, as detailed to the
present writer, was also that he and Doctor Overton,
as well as Doctor Blythe, lectured in 1815&ndash;16 to about
twenty students, of whom the late Doctor Ayres and
the yet surviving Nestor of Transylvania graduates,
Doctor Christopher C. Graham, of Louisville&mdash;now almost
a centenarian<a name="FNanchor_22_34" id="FNanchor_22_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_34" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>&mdash;were in attendance as pupils. Very
little can now be ascertained, from existing records, of
the character of Professor James Overton, M. D. Doctor
Christopher C. Graham, in a recent letter to the writer,
gives some of his reminiscences of him in the following
language: "Doctor Overton was a small, black-eyed man,
very hypochondrical and sarcastic (notoriously so), and
yet quite chatty, humorous, and agreeable; telling his
class many funny things.... He was well educated
for his day and plumed himself especially on his Greek."
Doctor Overton removed from Lexington to Nashville,
Tennessee, in 1818.<a name="FNanchor_23_35" id="FNanchor_23_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_35" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>The late Doctor Ayres, of Danville, and latterly of
Lexington, informed the writer that, in 1815, Doctor
Dudley, having recently returned from Europe, was
invited by himself and other medical students to demonstrate
to them in anatomy and surgery. Learning
<i>that he would lecture to them if a class were formed</i>, they
made up one of from twenty to twenty-five, and Doctor
Dudley lectured to them on anatomy and surgery in
"Trotter's Warehouse,"<a name="FNanchor_24_36" id="FNanchor_24_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_36" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> a house situated on the south-east
corner of Main and Mill streets, opposite the site<a name="FNanchor_25_37" id="FNanchor_25_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_37" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
of the old original Lexington block-house. In the next
winter, he recounts, he lectured to about fifty or sixty
students, some of whom were from Ohio. Doctors Overton
and Blythe, one or both, also lectured in both winters.</p>

<p>This may be said to be the real beginning of the successful
career of the Medical Department of Transylvania<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
University, and of that of Doctor Dudley as a
medical professor.</p>

<p>The <i>Kentucky Gazette</i> of March 10, 1817, contains a
card published by a committee of the medical students
of Transylvania, signed David J. Ayres, Thomas J.
Garden, and Charles H. Warfield (committee of the medical
class), headed a "Tribute of Gratitude," in which
they return grateful thanks to their professors, Doctors
B. W. Dudley, James Overton, and the Reverend Doctor
Blythe, for the ability, fidelity, and perseverance with
which they had taught. A further proof that a medical
session was held in the Transylvania School in 1816&ndash;17.</p>

<p>Many circumstances in these early times favored the
establishment of a medical college in Lexington. Not
only had that city been recognized for many years as a
great center of public education for the whole State&mdash;made
so by the location in it of the State's University,
"Transylvania"&mdash;but it was also at that time the great
metropolis of the West. The country around it, though
fast becoming settled and improved by enterprising
pioneers, had not as yet been provided with roads, or
good means of communication with older settlements.
To ascend the Ohio River and cross the Alleghany
Mountains to Philadelphia, where the only other medical
school then existed, was a tedious and laborious undertaking,
not devoid of danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>The celebrated French botanist, F. A. Michaux, who
visited this country in 1802, was obliged to walk most
of the way over the mountains to Pittsburg. Descending
the Ohio River in a canoe and landing at Limestone
(now Maysville), he consumed two days and a half on
horseback on his journey from that place to Lexington,
having been obliged to leave his baggage behind. The
late Professor Charles Caldwell records, in his remarkable
<i>Autobiography</i>, that as late as 1820, when he set out from
Lexington for Europe to purchase books and apparatus
for the Medical Department of Transylvania, he was
compelled to travel from Lexington to Maysville on horseback,
with his baggage on a pack-horse conducted by a
servant on a third horse. "The animals were all powerful
and active," but "so deep and adhesive was the mud
that they did not reach Maysville&mdash;only sixty miles distant&mdash;until
an early hour on the fourth day," although
diligence on his part was not wanting. Students of this
region had to overcome very great difficulties when they
set out in search of instruction in the medical schools
of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>On March 2, 1816, one thousand dollars were appropriated
by the Trustees of Transylvania and placed in
the hands of Doctor Blythe and John D. Clifford for the
immediate purchase of chemical apparatus. Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Blythe, who had been acting President of the University
up to this time, resigned and accepted the
position of Professor of Chemistry in the Medical
Department.</p>

<p>In 1817 the Medical Faculty was further reorganized
by the appointment of the late celebrated, talented
Doctor Daniel Drake to the chair of Materia Medica
and Medical Botany. The organization was then as
follows:</p>

<p>Doctor Benjamin W. Dudley, Professor of Anatomy
and Surgery.</p>

<p>Doctor James Overton, Professor of Theory and
Practice.</p>

<p>Doctor Daniel Drake, Professor of Materia Medica
and Medical Botany.</p>

<p>Doctor William H. Richardson, Professor of Obstetrics,
etc.</p>

<p>Doctor James Blythe, Professor of Chemistry, etc.</p>

<p>Doctor Drake has stated that twenty pupils attended
this course of lectures, and the degree of M. D. was&mdash;for
the first time in Lexington&mdash;conferred on John Lawson
McCullough of this city.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">

    <p class="caption">DOCTOR WILLIAM H. RICHARDSON.<br />From a Portrait by Jouett.</p>
</div>

<p>Each professor lectured three times a week, and his
ticket was fifteen dollars. During this session ill feelings
arose between Doctors Dudley and Drake, leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to the duel between Doctors Dudley and Richardson
already described.<a name="FNanchor_26_38" id="FNanchor_26_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_38" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Doctor Drake resigned his professorship and returned
to Cincinnati at the end of this session, returning subsequently
in 1823 to occupy the same chair, to resign
it again in 1827. Professor Richardson did not lecture
this session. He, not having yet received the degree of
M. D., was allowed to be absent.<a name="FNanchor_27_39" id="FNanchor_27_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_39" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Professor William Hall Richardson</span></h4>

<p>Taught in the Medical Department of Transylvania
until the time of his death in 1844, and was highly
respected by his pupils as a practical teacher in his especial
chair, notwithstanding he had not the advantage of
early educational training. He was a man of great
energy and of many admirable traits of character. His
pupil, the late Lewis Rogers, M. D., in his address as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
President of the Kentucky State Medical Society in 1873,
thus spoke of his old preceptor and friend:</p>

<p>"Few men ever had nobler traits of character. He
was warm-hearted, brave, and a sincere friend. I knew
him from my earliest boyhood, and have passed away
many happy and instructive hours at his magnificent
home in Fayette County.<a name="FNanchor_28_40" id="FNanchor_28_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_40" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> His hospitality was profuse
and elegant. I listened to his public teachings as a professor
with interest and care, because I knew he taught
the truth as far as he possessed it. He was not scholarly
or graceful and fluent as a lecturer, but he was ardent
and impressive, sufficiently learned in his special branch,
and had at his command a large stock of ripe experience.
I honor his memory beyond most men I have known."</p>

<p>In 1819, a new and brilliant era for the University,
and for the Medical Department of Transylvania, was
inaugurated by the appointment of Reverend Horace
Holley, LL. D., to the Presidency of the University.
Doctor Samuel Brown was recalled to the chair of the
Theory and Practice of Medicine, which he retained until
1825. Doctor Charles Caldwell was induced to remove
from Philadelphia, where he had an official connection
with the University of Pennsylvania, and to accept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
chair of the Institutes of Medicine and Materia Medica
here, thus completing the organization with the existing
professors, Benjamin W. Dudley and William H. Richardson,
and the election of Reverend James Blythe to
the chair of Chemistry. The celebrated naturalist, C. S.
Rafinesque, was advertised to lecture on Botany and
Natural History in this and the following year.<a name="FNanchor_29_41" id="FNanchor_29_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_41" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Constantine Samuel Rafinesque</span>,<a name="FNanchor_30_42" id="FNanchor_30_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_42" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></h4>

<p>A naturalist, antiquarian, etc., who stated in 1836
"that in knowledge he had been a botanist, naturalist,
conchologist, zoologist, geographer, esentographer, physiologist,
historian, antiquary, poet, philosopher, economist,
and philanthropist; and by profession a traveler, merchant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>manufacturer, collector, improver, professor,
teacher, surveyor, draftsman, architect, engineer, author,
editor, bookseller, librarian, secretary, chancellor, etc."&mdash;and
believed he could have been any thing, as he
"always succeeded in whatever he undertook." This
statement gives a key to his life, which was one of great
and untiring activity, as well as to his mental character,
which enabled him to acquire the reputation of being
one of the most learned men of his day. Born in Galata,
Constantinople, the son of a merchant, in 1784, after
living in France and Italy he came to America in 1802,
returning to France in 1805, with a very large botanical
collection. Spending ten years in Sicily in making
natural history collections and writing various essays,
he published in 1815 his <i>Analysis of Nature</i>. The
same year he sailed for America, but was wrecked on
Long Island, losing most of his collections and effects.
Induced to come West from Philadelphia by John D.
Clifford, of Lexington, in 1818, he was elected Professor
of Botany and Natural History in Transylvania University
in 1819, lectured to the students in the Medical
College, was librarian, and taught French, Spanish, and
Italian.<a name="FNanchor_31_43" id="FNanchor_31_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_43" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> He also traveled and made collections in
botany, natural history, etc., publishing various papers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and pamphlets and preparing materials for his proposed
great work, <i>Tellus, or the History of the Earth and
Mankind, Chiefly in America</i>, of which in ten years he
had, he said, prepared five thousand pages of manuscript
and five hundred maps and figures. An idea of what
this work might have been may be gathered from a
remarkable essay&mdash;<i>Ancient History or Annals of Kentucky</i>&mdash;which
was published in 1824 as an introduction
to <i>Marshall's History of Kentucky</i>, in which, in twenty-eight
small octavo pages, he professes to give not only
the migrations, changes, filiations, annals, and descriptions
of all the various tribes and peoples which inhabited
Kentucky since the creation of man, but gives also a
history of all the changes of geology and natural history,
according to his views and in accordance with Mosaic
cosmogony, substituting epochs for days, however. An
essay which may be characterized as a very terse and
dry recital of numerous doubtful statements, woven in
a web of very audacious speculation. His success as a
teacher in Transylvania was not great. He died in Philadelphia
September 18, 1840, having published in 1836
his life, travels, and researches in North America and
Europe from 1802 to 1835, and several small works on
natural history, botany, etc.</p>

<p>A project inaugurated by Rafinesque while professor
in Transylvania was that of a botanic garden at Lexington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
called "The Botanical Garden of Transylvania
University." A company was chartered by Act of Legislature
January 7, 1824, with a capital stock of twenty-five
thousand dollars, five hundred shares of fifty dollars
each. William H. Richardson, President; Thomas Smith,
Joseph Ficklin, John M. McCalla, Thomas L. Caldwell,
Directors; William A. Leavy, Treasurer; C. S. Rafinesque,
Secretary. Other members were William Leavy,
senior, Elisha Warfield, J. Harper, James W. Palmer, Horace
Holley, Charles Caldwell, Benjamin W. Dudley, Charles
Humphreys, Gabriel Slaughter, Thomas Wallace, John
Roche, Charles Wilkins, Benjamin Gratz, Richard Higgins,
John W. Hunt, B. R. McIlvaine, Joseph Boswell, Samuel
Brown, and Daniel Drake. We gather from the prospectus
(1824) that this garden was intended to be a
charming resort for the elite of Lexington, who were
expected to stroll at eve, perchance, through sylvan
bowers; it was also to benefit farmers and "the whole
Western country" by supplying "the best kinds of fruit
trees and grape vines, mountain rice, madder, senna,
opium, ginseng, rhubarb, castor oil, new kinds of grain
and pulse, etc." It was to be valuable especially to the
medical students of Transylvania by affording opportunity
to study the plants used in medicine. The single
product of opium, it was judged, could be made to cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the annual expense of the garden. There was to be "a
small but elegant building, with a portico, green-house,
aviaries, bowers, museum, library, and many other suitable
ornaments." Lectures and "practical demonstrations"
were to be given there in Botany, Agriculture,
Horticulture, Domestic Economy, etc. "Every individual
admitted in the garden to hear a course of lectures" to
pay "at least one dollar." To these ends a lot was procured
on the south side of East Main Street,<a name="FNanchor_32_44" id="FNanchor_32_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_44" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> within the
city limits, and gardening operations commenced; but
the garden was not a success. Though patronized for a
time, as in duty bound, by its influential shareholders
and diligently strolled in by the friends, principally, of
the medical students, it was, after the departure from
Lexington of Rafinesque, finally pronounced to be nothing
more than a weed-patch and abandoned before any
building was erected on it. In fact, from the testimony
of old citizens, it would appear that no improvements
were ever made there except the laying out of wide walks
and the planting of various shrubs and wild flowers,
chiefly such as were common upon the highways in Kentucky,
but which unquestionably seemed remarkable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Rafinesque, who viewed them with the eye of a botanist
exclusively.</p>

<p>The organization of the Medical Faculty of 1819,
already described, remained unchanged until 1823, when
Doctor Daniel Drake was recalled to the chair of Materia
Medica and Medical Botany, Doctor Caldwell retaining
that of the Institutes of Medicine. The chair of Chemistry
was also strengthened by the appointment of Doctor
Robert Best<a name="FNanchor_33_45" id="FNanchor_33_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_45" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> as adjunct professor, who resigned, however,
at the end of two years. Doctor Drake was transferred
in 1825 to the chair of Theory and Practice on
the resignation of Doctor Samuel Brown, and Doctor
Charles Wilkins Short was called to that vacated by
Doctor Drake. Doctor Drake resigned finally in 1826,
to be replaced by Doctor John Esten Cooke. We will
not in this place note all the changes which occurred
in the Faculty up to the time of its dissolution, but will
append them in the form of a schedule. (See Schedule A.)</p>

    <p class="caption">DANIEL DRAKE, M. D.</p>
</div>

<p>Born at Plainfield, New Jersey, October 20, 1785, and
brought to Mason County, Kentucky, in 1788, was, in
1800, the first medical student in Cincinnati. He began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
to practice in 1804, when he was only nineteen years
old. He spent the winter of 1805&ndash;6 as a student in
Philadelphia, and the succeeding year in practice at his
old home in Mayslick, removing for life to Cincinnati
in 1807.</p>

<p>He was made Professor of Materia Medica and Medical
Botany in Transylvania University in 1817, but returned
to Cincinnati to found the Medical College of Ohio in
1818, from which, however, his connection was suddenly
severed, after a bitter controversy, May, 1822. He
resumed a professorship at Lexington 1823&ndash;27, being
Dean of the Faculty, and declined a chair in the University
of Virginia in 1830. He accepted one in the
Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, 1830&ndash;31, and
again in the Medical College of Ohio in 1831&ndash;32. He
founded a new school as a department of Cincinnati College
and taught in it 1835&ndash;39; was professor in the Louisville
Medical Institute 1839&ndash;49, and afterward accepted
a chair in the Medical College again in 1849&ndash;50. In 1827
he was editor of the <i>Western Medical and Physical Journal</i>,
etc., but his chief work is his <i>Treatise on the Principal
Diseases of the Interior Valley of America</i>, published in
1850&mdash;a wonderful tribute to American medical science.
His contributions to scientific journals were numerous,
and many of his medical lectures and scientific and historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
addresses have been published.<a name="FNanchor_34_46" id="FNanchor_34_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_46" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> He died at
Cincinnati November 5, 1852, aged sixty-seven years.<a name="FNanchor_35_47" id="FNanchor_35_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_47" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Doctor David W. Yandell says: "As a lecturer Doctor
Drake had few equals. He was never dull. His was
an alert and masculine mind. His words are full of
vitality. His manner was earnest and impressive. His
eloquence was fervid." Soon after Doctor Yandell had
entered the practice of medicine Doctor Drake told him:
"I have never seen a great and permanent practice the
foundations of which were not laid in the hearts of the
poor. Therefore cultivate the poor. If you need another
though sordid reason, the poor of to-day are the rich
of to-morrow in this country. The poor will be the most
grateful of all your patients. Lend a willing ear to all
their calls."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Such enthusiasm in the establishment of the Medical
Department of Transylvania existed at this time (1819)
that liberal citizens of Lexington freely subscribed money
to the amount of more than three thousand dollars to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
guarantee to Professors Caldwell and Brown each an
annual sum of a thousand dollars for three years, and
this salary was paid to them accordingly. Professor
Caldwell visiting the Legislature of Kentucky in 1820,
induced that body to give five thousand dollars for the
express purpose of the purchase of books and apparatus
for the Medical College in Transylvania University, which,
as declared in the Act, was to remain "the property of
the State of Kentucky."</p>

<p>Moreover, the city of Lexington at the same time
loaned to the college, for the same specified purpose, six
thousand dollars, reserving a lien on the books. This
loan subsequently became a donation. In addition many
physicians of the South, of Kentucky, and of Lexington
made further subscriptions, making altogether a gross
sum of about thirteen thousand dollars, with which Professor
Caldwell was enabled to purchase in Europe, in
1820, the foundation of the library, apparatus, and
museum of the Medical Department.<a name="FNanchor_36_48" id="FNanchor_36_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_48" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Again, in 1827, certain citizens of Lexington and
medical professors, forming a joint-stock company, furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the means to build the first Medical Hall for the
special uses of this department, on which, until 1839,
when a new Medical Hall was erected, the medical professors
paid an annual interest of six per cent on the cost.
This old hall stood, before it was destroyed by fire (in
1854, while being used as a City Hall, etc.), on the site
of the Lexington City Library, corner of Market and
Church streets. It is thus described in the <i>Transylvania
Journal of Medicine</i>, Volume I, 1828: "This building,
a vignette view of which is seen on the cover of this
Journal, was erected by the private munificence of citizens
of Lexington during the last season. The corner-stone
was laid with Masonic ceremonies on the fifteenth day
of April, and the edifice was complete and in readiness
for the reception of the medical class at the commencement
of the session the first of November.</p>

<p>"In an excavation made in the corner-stone was
deposited a glass bottle enclosing a parchment roll on
which were written the name of the President of the
United States, those of the heads of departments, the
Trustees of Transylvania University, the medical professors,
trustees of the town, officers of the Grand Lodge
who assisted at the ceremony, building committee, architect,
etc. On a marble tablet over the front door of
the house is the following inscription:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">COLL. TRANSYL. MEDIC.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">FUND. A. D. MDCCCXVII.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Though plain and unostentatious, the style of
its architecture is chaste and neat, its execution is
solid and substantial, and its interior arrangements
are of the most convenient, comfortable, and commodious
kind.</p>

<p>"The basement story of the building is chiefly appropriated
to the chemical professorship and contains a
lecture-room forty-five by fifty feet in dimensions, in
which the seats and lecturing stand are arranged in the
best manner for perfect vision, a lobby, an anti-room,
a chemical laboratory well supplied with all necessary
apparatus, and a dormitory for a resident pupil who
acts as librarian.</p>

<p>"These in connection with the very handsome
and commodious anatomical amphitheater which was
built during the preceding season, together with its
preparing- and dissecting-rooms, present a suit of
lecture-rooms, apartments, etc., not surpassed in
point of excellence of light for demonstration, or in
ease, comfort, and convenience to the pupil by any
similar institution in America. The whole is situated
in a pleasant and central part of the town, easily accessible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
from the chief boarding-houses in the worst
weather."<a name="FNanchor_37_49" id="FNanchor_37_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_49" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
<a name="FNanchor_38_50" id="FNanchor_38_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_50" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>From the time of the reorganization in 1819, the classes
in the Medical College increased rapidly&mdash;from only
twenty, with a single graduate in 1817&ndash;18, to two hundred
students and fifty-six graduates in the session of
1823&ndash;24. A rapid increase in patronage almost unparalleled
in the history of medical schools, owing, no doubt,
largely to the great increasing demand for medical instruction
in this fast improving country and to the temporary
extreme difficulty of the journey to the great medical
school of Philadelphia, but also to the <i>eclat</i> of the University
under the administration of Doctor Holley,<a name="FNanchor_39_51" id="FNanchor_39_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_51" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> to the
just fame of Doctor Dudley as a surgeon and medical
teacher, to the reputation of Doctor Samuel Brown as a
popular and cultivated physician and professor, and to
the brilliant and popular talents of Doctor Charles
Caldwell.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Doctor Charles Caldwell.</span></h4>

<p>The association of this distinguished professor with
the fortunes of the Medical Department of Transylvania,
which extended from 1819 to 1837, marked the era of
its most rapid development, and embraced a large portion
of the time of its greatest prosperity.</p>

<p>The life, character, and writings of Doctor Caldwell
are no doubt now well known to the medical profession
through the numerous biographical notices which have
appeared, especially those by the late Professor Lunsford
P. Yandell, M. D., in Lindley's <i>Medical Annals of Tennessee</i>,
and as amplified in the <i>Transactions</i> of the Kentucky
State Medical Society in its twenty-first annual
session in 1876, and other published sketches. But it
may also be studied in his somewhat unfortunate <i>Autobiography</i>,
which was published in Philadelphia in 1855,
two years after his death, edited by the sister of his
widow, Miss Harriet W. Warner.</p>

<p>It is said of Titian, that when in his old age he took
it into his head to <i>improve</i> some of his best pictures by
retouching them, his judicious pupils mixed his paints
with olive oil so they would not dry and could be easily
washed off again, thus restraining him from marring or
destroying his finest works and his fame together. Fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
would it have been for the venerable Doctor Caldwell
had much of this senile production&mdash;written only
seven or eight years before his death&mdash;been canceled
by a friendly hand. The too harsh criticisms in which
he indulged, which placed some of his late colleagues
sharply on the defensive and which also gave them powerful
weapons of offense, as well as defense, had then been
suppressed!</p>

<p>On Page 315 of this autobiography he characterized
the time-honored maxim, "<i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>,"
as "an ill-founded and dangerous precept." Hence
Doctor Yandell, whom he had denounced in this work
in the most opprobrious terms, felt justified in his notice
of this autobiography in his paper on the <i>Medical Literature
of Kentucky</i>, published in the <i>Transactions of the
Kentucky State Medical Society</i>, 1876, Page 62, in the
following terms: "It is not only egotistical and vainglorious
beyond anything, I believe, to be found in the
English language, but it is at the same time defamatory.
The author holds himself up to admiration on all occasions
and everywhere from boyhood to old age a very
hero of romance." And literal quotations from the
unfortunate volume give support to these allegations.</p>

<p>Under the provocation of Doctor Caldwell's posthumous
attack, Doctor Yandell defended himself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
retorted with the weapons which Doctor Caldwell himself
had supplied. But, in later years, not long before his
death, Doctor Yandell expressed to the writer, in a friendly
letter, something like regret that he had not in this case
adhered more closely to that maxim in relation to the
dead, above quoted, which Doctor Caldwell had condemned
as "ill-founded and dangerous." It must be
admitted, however, that the provocation was great.<a name="FNanchor_40_52" id="FNanchor_40_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_52" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Doctor Caldwell was born, the youngest son of a large
family, May 14, 1772, in Caswell County, North Carolina,
and died in Louisville July 9, 1853, in his eighty-third
year. His parents had emigrated from Ireland.
His father&mdash;who was described by Doctor James Blythe,
who knew him, as "very poor, and very, very pious"&mdash;destined
Charles for the Presbyterian ministry. Accordingly
he was measurably released from the labor of the
farm on which the family lived and was allowed to pursue
his studies in a solitary log hut which he had built for
himself for the purpose&mdash;"his books his chief companions."</p>

<p>He says he commenced to learn the ancient languages
at twelve, and was already principal of a literary academy
at eighteen. He says further of himself: "From an
early period of my life I was actuated by a form of ambition
and a love of disquisition and mental contest, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
not only marked in me somewhat of a peculiarity of native
mind and spirit, but tended also to strengthen them."
In his subsequent life he delighted in debates, discussions,
and mental contests. He acknowledges (Page 53)
an early propensity to array himself in argument "on
the wrong side of the question under consideration, in
order the more certainly to produce discussion by my
advocacy of a paradox, and to make a show of my ingenuity
and ability in defense of error."</p>

<p>But, as he acknowledged, "this kind of gladiatorship
began to blunt his appreciation of truth as distinguished
from error, and hence he endeavored to restrain this
impulse"&mdash;not always successfully, perhaps.</p>

<p>Although his taste and talents inclined him to the
legal profession he was induced to study medicine, somewhat
against his own judgment. His medical education
was obtained in Philadelphia, in the Medical Department
of the University of Pennsylvania, then the only
medical college in America, which he entered in 1792,
and from which he graduated. While there he industriously
employed his time and faculties in study, debate,
and discussion, and his pen in numerous publications,
the principal of which was a translation of Blumenbach's
<i>Elements of Physiology</i>&mdash;which he completed before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>graduation. He managed to antagonize, amongst many
others, his medical preceptor, the celebrated Doctor
Rush, much to his own detriment, as he in his autobiography
acknowledges.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1793, on the outbreak of the
yellow fever in Philadelphia, he distinguished himself by
his courage and self-sacrifice in voluntarily attending
and nursing the sick. And again, by his pen and otherwise,
in theoretical discussions on the origin of the
pestilence.</p>

<p>According to his own representations and the testimony
of his friends, he was exceedingly methodical in his
habits, dividing his time with rigorous system; but we
may well feel a little skeptical as to his assertion that
he "rarely slept more than four hours," and at one time
but three hours and a half. His mental activity and
labor, however, in his youth, must have been very great.
Apart from his necessary studies and his active and constant
participation in the discussions of the Medical
Society, he delivered more public addresses, for the
Society and on other occasions, "than all the other members
of the institution united" (Page 254), besides
employing his pen in numerous ephemeral productions
for the press.</p>

<p>In speaking of his early life in Philadelphia (Page 330)
he says: "I was a young man for the scenes in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
I had acted; proud and ambitious certainly, and probably
not altogether untinctured with vanity.... In truth
it is hardly to be denied that, for a time at least, I was
somewhat spoiled [by the compliments paid him] on
account of my attributes and performances, both mental
and corporal.... No wonder, therefore, that I felt, or
conceited I felt, a decided superiority to most medical
pupils, as well as the ordinary cast of young physicians....
I certainly did both indulge and manifest it to the
extent, at times, of giving serious offense." This was
not the worst. His bold self-confidence and assertion
having placed him in a position of antagonism toward
his friend and preceptor, Doctor Rush, as well as toward
other influential medical men of Philadelphia, defeated
the great ambition of his life&mdash;that of occupying the chair
of the Institutes of Medicine in the Medical College of
the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>When informed by Doctor Rush (Page 290, autobiography)
that although his friends spoke in flattering
terms of "your talents, attainments, and powers in lecturing
and instruction ... they are reluctant to recommend
you to the Board of Trustees in the light of a professor,"
he indignantly declared that "if the door of the
University of Pennsylvania was thus closed to him he
would soon occupy a chair equally honorable with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of Doctor Rush in some other school." And he shortly
thereafter was induced to push his fortunes in the great
and growing West.</p>

<p>Coming to Lexington with his shining and commanding
talents, his determination to conquer success, and
the brilliant reputation he then had as an independent
writer and lecturer; to become associated with the yet
more brilliant President Holley, and the already well-known
and appreciated medical teachers, Doctors Dudley
and Brown; at an auspicious time when the rapidly
improving country felt the want of medical instruction
at home&mdash;the rapid success of the Medical Department
of Transylvania (to which he materially contributed by
his able efforts before the public) might well excuse him
in his belief<a name="FNanchor_41_53" id="FNanchor_41_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_53" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> that he had come to Lexington to be the
"<i>premier of the school</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_42_54" id="FNanchor_42_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_54" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> that he had come to train and
induct his colleagues ("a most miserable Faculty," he
calls them) into efficiency and fame, and that the success
of medical education in Lexington was due mainly to
his individual efforts. Candor obliges us to admit, however,
that there is some truth in the statement of the
late Professor Yandell, in the memoir above quoted.
Doctor Yandell was a student in the Medical Department
of Transylvania in 1823, and a most ardent admirer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the brilliant talents of Professor Caldwell, yet he found
that both Professors Dudley and Drake were more popular
with the students, as teachers, than he. He says
(Page 56): "Students, in truth, generally turned listlessly
away from his polished discourses on Sympathy,
Phrenology,<a name="FNanchor_43_55" id="FNanchor_43_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_55" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> the Vital Principle, and other kindred
themes, and hurried off to the lectures on Materia Medica
and Anatomy."<a name="FNanchor_44_56" id="FNanchor_44_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_56" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>In short, Doctor Caldwell excelled in the brilliant
discussion of speculative and theoretical subjects. The
extent of his positive knowledge, as remarked by Doctor
Yandell, was greater in superficial area than in depth;
whilst in the terse and lucid exposition of definite facts,
which characterized the instruction of Professor Dudley,
the student felt he was acquiring knowledge which not
only was real but was of practical utility.</p>

<p>The history of the <i>rise and fall</i> of this school of medicine
is illustrated in the detailed list of its classes and
graduates as shown in the annexed <i>Schedule B</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>The total number of students in the Medical School
of Transylvania during the term of its existence was,
as far as can now be ascertained, more than six thousand
four hundred (6,456); the total number of its medical
graduates eighteen hundred and eighty-one (1,881).<a name="FNanchor_45_57" id="FNanchor_45_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_57" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
During the late civil war the commodious Medical Hall
of Transylvania, built in 1839 by the munificence of the
city of Lexington, and which had been seized by the
United States Government for use as a United States
General Hospital, was destroyed by fire while occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
for that purpose.<a name="FNanchor_46_58" id="FNanchor_46_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_58" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> But the medical library,<a name="FNanchor_47_59" id="FNanchor_47_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_59" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> apparatus
and museum, etc., were mainly preserved, and are now
in the custody of the Curators of Kentucky University,
with which institution old Transylvania University was
consolidated in 1865, "all the trusts and conditions"
of her property being preserved in the Act of Consolidation.</p>

<p>The Medical Department may yet be resuscitated
when in the course of events our city again becomes an
eligible site for modern medical instruction, and when
special means can be obtained properly to equip and
re-establish it on a basis suited to the existing times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>The gradual decline of this school, like its rapid rise,
was due greatly to the changing conditions of the country.
When, shortly after 1812, steamboat navigation began
to manifest its superiority and influence on the channels
of commerce, population and business deserted measurably
the interior routes and locations and transferred
themselves to the river valleys and neighborhoods. Gradually
during this change&mdash;notwithstanding the talents,
ability, and fame of our Brown, Dudley, Caldwell, Cooke,
Short, Yandell, Bartlett, Mitchell, Smith, and others,
and the generous support of the city&mdash;the school declined;
more especially because of the establishment of rival
colleges at more eligible points, in growing and populous
cities. Lexington lost its pre-eminence as the "<i>Metropolis
of the Western Country</i>," and Cincinnati, Louisville,
St. Louis, and other places which had been villages
supplied with her manufactures, rapidly became great
cities; while she declined from a population of about
eight thousand in 1814, down to a little over four thousand
in 1820, with an immense loss to her citizens in the
value of her property and the destruction of her industries.
In this year (1820) the population of Cincinnati,
which in 1810 had been only two thousand, three hundred
and twenty, had risen to nine thousand, six hundred
and forty-four; and in 1830, when the population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
of Lexington was yet only five thousand, six hundred
and sixty-two, that of Cincinnati was twenty-four thousand,
eight hundred and thirty-one. When the present
writer came to Lexington in 1832 the population had
remained nearly the same, and an era of decrepitude
and decline of all her industries still prevailed. Lexington
had not yet finished her first railroad.</p>

<p>This railroad, the "Lexington &amp; Ohio," was begun
in 1831 and completed as far as Frankfort&mdash;twenty-eight
miles&mdash;in 1835. It was composed of stone sills
laid side by side, with a dressed surface on the portion
upon which the wheels were to run. The cars resembled
an old pattern of street car and were drawn by horses.</p>

<p>The imposing ceremony of laying the first "stone
sill" took place on Water Street, October 21, 1831, "amid
a vast throng of people." Indeed, it was made a very
great occasion, which might have been marked with
still greater pomp and circumstance, as the newspapers
inform us, had "more notice been given beforehand."
As it was, a large procession, civic and military, was
formed, marshaled by General Leslie Combs, the renowned
"boy-captain of 1812," assisted by handsome James B.
Coleman. Three military companies, including "Hunt's
Artillery" and "Captain Neet's Rifle Guards," were on
parade with a fine military band playing "Yankee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Doodle," "Hail, Columbia," and other patriotic airs.
Major-General Pendleton and staff, on horseback, led
the march. Governor Metcalfe and Reverend Nathan H.
Hall supported the orator of the day. The Trustees of
the town, the President and Directors of the railroad,
the President and all the officers and Trustees of Transylvania
University, and all the societies of the University
and of the town, were in line. "At eleven o'clock,"
says the <i>Lexington Reporter</i>, "the three military companies
which formed the escort marched from the place
of rendezvous to the college lawn, where they were met
by the various societies and individuals. For many years
we have not witnessed such a pageant, and never a more
interesting.</p>

<p>"The procession first moved in a circle around the
lawn where it was formed, at which time the bells in
the various churches in town commenced a merry peal
which continued till the procession reached the place
where the ceremony was performed. The military escort
then formed a hollow square, within which the whole
civic procession was enclosed. Thousands of anxious
and delighted spectators were on the outside, among
whom we were gratified to see a large concourse of ladies,
for whose accommodation the marshal had directed
the adjacent market-house to be appropriated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>"Doctor Caldwell then delivered a highly interesting
and appropriate address.</p>

<p>"A Federal salute was fired at sunrise, and seven
guns when the first stone sill was laid, indicating the
seven sections of the road under contract."</p>

<p>Doctor Caldwell spoke in polished and eloquent phrase
of the advantages accruing to Lexington and the whole
adjacent country from the establishment of this road.
He prophesied also great benefit to Louisville therefrom.</p>

<p>We learn from the same old newspaper that Doctor
Caldwell was announced to deliver a lecture, a few evenings
later, at the first meeting of the "Lexington
Lyceum," at the court house. The subject of the lecture
was "The Moral and Incidental Influences of Railroads."
"Ladies and strangers" were invited to attend.</p>

<p>But in later days, in competition with the steamboat,
the newer and swifter mode of transportation&mdash;the railroad&mdash;has
been gradually but surely restoring to the inland
regions, and to Lexington, their lost prosperity. Our
city has steadily risen to about seventeen thousand (1873),
with a good prospect of a further increase of prosperity
and population as railroads centering here may be
extended. Then may we hope to put into active operation
once more our time-honored Medical College, and
to attract to it a creditable number of students. More<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
particularly if, with the co-operation of the more enlightened
members of our profession, an effort be faithfully
made in the renovated college to bring about the much-needed
reform in medical education, the necessity for
which is now generally recognized. So that the mere
fact of a student attending two courses of lectures, with
other somewhat easy requisitions, may not entitle him
to the degree of Doctor of Medicine, as has been too frequently
the case amongst competing medical colleges.
That full preparation and training, in a sufficient period
of time, shall be required of the candidates into whose
hands the health and lives of communities are to be committed.
On such a basis&mdash;when our city may have
acquired increased facilities for clinical instruction, and
when anatomical studies will not be cramped for want
of means of demonstration&mdash;the old Medical College of
Transylvania may revive under the wing of a people's
educational institution such as Transylvania is and always
was&mdash;a "<i>State University</i>."</p>

<p>Difficulties in the procurement of a sufficient supply
of material for anatomical instruction, coupled with the
demand for clinical teaching which was beginning to be
urged by the profession, forced themselves on the attention
of the Medical Faculty of Transylvania before the
year 1836&ndash;37. But in that year a determined effort was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
made, engineered and led by Professor Caldwell, to remove
the Medical College to Louisville, that city having been
induced by the earnest and eloquent appeals of Caldwell
to offer it a large bonus. But for the early withdrawal
of Doctor Dudley from this promising scheme,
toward which he was at first inclined&mdash;because mainly
of his difficulties in the supply of anatomical material&mdash;it
would have been successful. But Doctor Dudley
finally declined to remove, much to the mortification of
Doctor Caldwell, who, in his last valedictory to the graduates
of 1837, indulged in a very bitter impersonal-personal
tirade against deception and mendacity, aimed at
Doctor Dudley&mdash;not saying openly to his colleague "thou
art the man"&mdash;but hoping "the cap would fit him" and
find its place. The Trustees of the University, of course,
and influential citizens, violently opposed the proposed
change. Doctor Caldwell was arraigned before the Board
on charges preferred by Doctor Dudley, the principal of
which was that he had been engaged in the enterprise
of originating a rival medical college in Louisville while
he was yet a professor in the Transylvania College and
under oath to support it. Doctor Caldwell, disdaining
to answer the summons of the Board, was, after a long
and full investigation of the evidence, dismissed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
his chair in Transylvania. The Medical Faculty was
then dissolved and reorganized.<a name="FNanchor_48_60" id="FNanchor_48_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_60" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Doctors Cooke and Yandell, and finally Doctor Short,
joined Doctor Caldwell to aid in the establishment of
the <i>Louisville Medical Institute</i>. Professors Dudley and
Richardson and the assistant professors, Bush and Peter,
remained in Lexington. The celebrated Professor John
Eberle was called to the chair of Theory and Practice,
but he died shortly after the delivery of his introductory
lecture. Professor Thomas D. Mitchell was appointed to
the chair of Chemistry, etc., and Doctor James C. Cross
to that of the Institutes of Medicine.<a name="FNanchor_49_61" id="FNanchor_49_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_61" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Doctor John Esten Cooke</span></h4>

<p>Removed from Virginia in 1827 to fill the chair of the
Theory and Practice of Medicine in Transylvania University,
which had just been vacated by Doctor Drake.
He had already acquired a high reputation as a practitioner
of medicine; he had published an able essay on
autumnal fever in the <i>Medical Recorder</i> for 1824, and had
in the same year produced the first volume of his very
remarkable <i>Treatise on Pathology and Therapeutics</i>, the
second volume of which he published in Lexington
in 1828. The promised third volume, which was to complete
the work, never appeared. He remained in Transylvania
Medical School until 1837, when, under the
leadership of Doctor Caldwell, he with Doctor Yandell,
removed to Louisville to engage in originating a new
medical college, the "<i>Louisville Medical Institute</i>." In
this and in its successor, the "<i>Medical Department of
the Louisville University</i>," he remained until a few years
before his death, which occurred on his farm on the Ohio
River above Louisville, October 19, 1853, in the seventy-first
year of his age.</p>

    <p class="caption">DOCTOR JOHN ESTEN COOKE.<br />From a Photograph.</p>
</div>

<p>Doctor Cooke was in many respects a remarkable
man, who acquired a widespread reputation in this country,
especially in the Mississippi Valley. His fame was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
mainly built on his celebrated theory of the universal
origin of disease, which was, that disease was caused
by cold or malaria. That especially it commenced in
weakened action of the heart, resulting in <i>congestion of
the vena cava</i>, its branches and capillary distribution,
and that fever was but the reaction of the vital force to
overcome this condition, which unrelieved would result
in death. According to him, all autumnal and malarial
fevers were but variations of one diseased condition, and
even those fearful scourges the plague, cholera, yellow
fever, dysentery, etc., were simply varied forms and
conditions of congestion of the <i>vena cava</i>.</p>

<p>To destroy this many-headed hydra&mdash;while he would
use cold water to reduce too great febrile excitement
and even sometimes give antimonial wine<a name="FNanchor_50_62" id="FNanchor_50_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_62" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>&mdash;his main
reliance was on blood-letting and cholagogue purgatives,
as he believed it was by increasing the secretion of the
liver and causing it to pour out consistent "black bile"
that the venous congestion was to be relieved and the
patient cured.</p>

<p>Amongst all these remedies calomel was his chief
reliance, and was given by him in doses not measured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
by the balance but by the effect they produced; so that
in the latter days of practice&mdash;notably during the epidemic
of cholera in Lexington in 1833&mdash;he absolutely
resorted to tablespoonful doses of this mercurial, repeated
<i>pro re nata</i>; actually giving about <i>one pound</i> in one day
to a young patient, without fatal result.</p>

<p>Two cases may be quoted from his own paper in the
<i>Transylvania Medical Journal</i>, and from Doctor Yandell's
<i>Memoir of Doctor Cooke</i> in the <i>American Practitioner</i>
for July, 1875. "William Douglass, a student of theology,
nineteen years of age, took a tablespoonful (about
two ounces) every six hours for three days in succession,
having taken the same quantity the evening before; in
all, thirteen tablespoonfuls. He was in collapse when
he took the first dose. On the third morning after beginning
this treatment his discharges were found to have
become thick and green, and Doctor Cooke thought he
would have recovered but for the indiscretion of his
attendant, who had him to walk across a large room
from one bed to another more than once. Hiccough
came on, the patient became delirious, and died on the
sixth day. But another patient recovered about this
time under similar treatment, and still lives, I believe&mdash;a
useful Episcopal clergyman, and an illustration of the
extent to which calomel may be employed in some diseases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
without injury to health. Mr. Brittan, a young theological
student, took a tablespoonful of calomel soon
after having had several copious watery discharges. He
was advised to repeat the dose every six hours, until
the watery discharges ceased. He took, that day, four
and on the next, three of these doses; the discharges
not ceasing until some time after the seventh dose had
been taken. He took, moreover, three similar doses
during the same time&mdash;having thrown up three. The
<i>repeated doses</i> were given immediately after the regular
ones were thrown up. Bilious discharges appeared on
the evening of the second day, and were kept up by tincture
of aloes and occasionally pills of aloes and rhubarb
for a week. The patient was somewhat salivated, but
recovered. I saw him a number of years afterwards in
perfect health."</p>

<p>Doctor Yandell asserts in this memoir that in this
"extraordinary practice, Doctor Cooke was not less successful
in the treatment of cholera than his medical
brethren in Lexington." But the fact was that none
were very successful and that as many as fifty died in a
day of a population of a little over six thousand.<a name="FNanchor_51_63" id="FNanchor_51_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_63" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The
writer recollects that Doctor Cooke only practiced in
the earlier period of this famous epidemic, having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
disabled by a fall in attempting, in his hurry to attend
a professional call, to put on his coat while running down
stairs.</p>

<p>In another case of cholera which occurred at this time,
as the present writer was informed by the intelligent
and truthful brother of the young lady patient of Doctor
Cooke, these large tablespoonful doses passed through
the bowels apparently unchanged, being discharged in
lumps as large as pullets' eggs, without being even dissolved.
This patient did not recover.</p>

<p>Calomel is well known to be practically insoluble
in pure water at the common temperature. It is decomposed
to a certain extent by the action of light,
or by a moderate heat in the presence of water, and
especially by the aid of acids of various kinds, and
by certain salts such as alkaline and other soluble
chlorides&mdash;especially potassium, sodium, and ammonium
chlorides.</p>

<p>In all these cases of partial decomposition some of
the mercurous chloride&mdash;the calomel&mdash;is changed into
soluble mercuric chloride and metallic mercury. This
decomposition is supposed to result from the action of
the alkaline chlorides and the chloro-hydric and other
acids of the gastric juice when calomel is taken into the
stomach under ordinary circumstances. It is believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
that the activity of the calomel depends mainly on the
amount of this decomposition which takes place in the
body.</p>

<p>Especially does this partial decomposition of calomel
into corrosive sublimate occur, to a great extent, when
it is mixed in water with sal-ammoniac (ammonium
chloride), as has been experienced in cases of poisoning
by the administration of even moderate doses of calomel
which had been mixed with this salt. In an experiment
by the present writer in which three tenths of a gram
of calomel and one and two tenths of a gram of sal-ammoniac
with ten grams of water were allowed to react
at the common temperature for twenty-four hours, as
much as 0.019 of a gram of corrosive sublimate was found.</p>

<p>No doubt these facts throw much light on the very
irregular action of calomel in different persons and under
various conditions, in doses which may be very small
or very large. We can easily understand how, when the
stomach secretes no gastric juice and when the salts of
the blood have been greatly reduced in quantity by
watery purging as in cholera, the calomel may pass
through the alimentary canal unchanged, insoluble and
inactive, or exert a doubtful topical action only.</p>

<p>The present writer's own experience&mdash;when he was
a medical student, and when fully impressed by the sincere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and logical teachings of Doctor Cooke, who, however
halting and hesitating may have been his manner
or unadorned his style of lecturing, always commanded
the fixed attention and highest respect of his pupils&mdash;soon
opened his eyes to the faults in the theory of the
professor.</p>

<p>On one occasion, having been brought into a somewhat
febrile condition by fatigue in a botanical excursion
in hot weather, and having full faith in the statements
of Doctor Cooke to the effect that calomel was
of all antifebrile remedies the best, and that while a
small dose of calomel might prove irritating <i>a good large
dose</i> "would sometimes act like an opiate," he took a
one drachm dose in full confidence. But instead of the
soothing, curative effect he had been led to expect, vomiting
and severe irritation of the stomach resulted, so much
so that no food but boiled milk could be tolerated for
a week or so afterward. Shaken in his faith by his first
experience, but not yet convinced of the error of the doctrine
of his respected preceptor, the second trial of a
drachm dose on a similar occasion completely satisfied
him that something wrong had crept into the theory
and practice of the honored professor.</p>

<p>Doctor Cooke's only fear in his heroic use of calomel
was that it would salivate. But for this untoward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
influence, he said, one might do almost anything with it.
That this substance which, in cases of cholera, he administered
so largely with no signs of irritation or salivation,
until the patient was in a convalescent state, should
sometimes in much smaller doses prove an irritant poison,
he did not understand. A quotation from Doctor Yandell's
<i>Memoir</i>, Page 7, illustrates this: "In some cases
of fever Doctor Cooke administered a drachm of calomel
at a dose, and repeated it until the patient had taken
in twenty-four hours as much as two hundred and forty
grains. A young lady was thus treated in 1826. After
this quantity had been given she seemed much relieved,
but to avert the danger of salivation he thought it prudent
to administer jalap and cream of tartar. At night
they were thrown up, without producing any purgative
effect. She then took a drachm of calomel, and repeated
it until she had taken five doses in the course of the
night and morning, with the same fine effect in producing
abundant bilious discharges, and a remarkably good
effect on the symptoms generally." Still uneasy about
ptyalism, he gave her cream of tartar all day, but at
night it was thrown up as before, without moving the
bowels. "My fears of the consequence of giving the
only medicine which offered any prospect of saving her,"
he adds, "held my hand, and she continued to vomit till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
death relieved her. I reproached myself on her account
afterward, and felt conscious that fear of a remote and
uncertain evil had induced me to stand and see her die
without doing all I might have done. I was convinced
she would not have died had the calomel been continued."</p>

<p>After she had thus taken more than an ounce of calomel
he honestly believed that he had not given her
enough of this medicine! Entirely ignoring the action
of the cream of tartar in bringing this substance partly
into the condition of a soluble irritant poison!</p>

<p>To convince myself of this decomposing action of
cream of tartar on calomel, I placed about a drachm of
calomel in each of two small beaker glasses. In the one
I put pure distilled water, in the other I added to the
water about a drachm of cream of tartar. Heating them
to about blood heat and allowing them to stand for a
few hours, I filtered both liquids from the undissolved
calomel. Ammonium sulphide, added to the filtered
fluids, threw down from that which contained the cream
of tartar a sensible amount of dark mercurial sulphide,
while that which contained pure water gave no notable
reaction. Evidently the cream of tartar had caused the
decomposition of some of the insoluble calomel and had
produced a soluble mercurial compound. All soluble
compounds of mercury are active poisons in small doses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
while, as was fully proven by Doctor Cooke's extraordinary
practice with this substance, pure unchanged calomel
is one of the most insoluble substances. Consequently
it sometimes proved harmless in very large doses,
as was the case when the copious watery discharges of
cholera had removed most of the salts of the blood.</p>

<p>The Doctor took no note of possible agencies which
might make his master remedy occasionally poisonous,
and scouted the careful practice of some of the older
physicians in causing their patients to abstain from the
use of common salt while taking calomel, a recommendation
based upon valid experience, no doubt, which
science has verified.</p>

<p>The Doctor rose to two ounces, or tablespoonful doses,
during the prevalence of Asiatic cholera in Lexington,
but he did not confine this treatment to that fearful
disease. The present writer has preserved one of the last
of his mammoth doses&mdash;one of a dozen of the same
weight (about an ounce)&mdash;which he prescribed for a
medical student of the session of 1836&ndash;37, the subject of
pneumonia, and who took eleven such doses in regular
succession before he died.</p>

<p>In Doctor Cooke's earlier practice, and in the treatment
of less severe cases, he relied greatly on his famous
pills&mdash;well known in the region of Lexington as "Cooke's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Pills"&mdash;composed of equal parts of calomel, aloes, and
rhubarb; or on tincture of aloes and the lancet, with
the occasional use of a few other remedies. These constituted
his sole armament with which to encounter
disease. For he was a man of the strictest and most
earnest honesty, sincerity, and zeal, and withal so wedded
to his logical convictions that he would at any time have
died a martyr to his well-matured beliefs. Indeed,
according to the testimony of his friend, the late Lunsford
P. Yandell, he seems thus to have been to some
extent a martyr to his own theory and practice.</p>

<p>On Page 22 of Doctor Yandell's <i>Memoir of Doctor
Cooke</i>, we are informed that "his practice on himself
was of the same heroic character that he pursued with
his patients. He bled himself at once copiously and
repeated the operation again and again as symptoms
appeared to him to demand it, at the same time keeping
up purgation with calomel. Exposed as he was on his
farm, these attacks became frequent and his constitution,
naturally enfeebled by increasing years, at length
gave way under them."</p>

<p>Again, on Page 27 of the same <i>Memoir</i>, Doctor Yandell
says: "The perfect sincerity with which he held
his opinions was evinced by his carrying out his practice
in his own case. On one occasion this was near costing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
him his life. He was seized with intermittent fever, on
his farm near Louisville in the fall of 1844, and for several
days took his pills&mdash;composed of calomel, rhubarb, and
aloes&mdash;in the confident belief that they would arrest the
disease; but the chills continued to recur with an increasing
tendency to congestion until at last his case became
alarming. His old friend, General Mercer, of Virginia,
who happened to be on a visit to him at the time, called
on me and gave me an account of his situation, asking
me to visit him. Doctor Cooke was reluctant to take
quinine, but finally consented and was relieved, and
afterward, I believe, used the remedy in his practice."</p>

<p>A characteristic anecdote is recorded of him in <i>Collins'
History of Kentucky</i>. "One Sunday morning, waiting on
some of his family to get ready for church&mdash;the Methodist
church, of which he and they were members&mdash;he
picked up a discourse by the Reverend Doctor Chapman,
then Episcopal clergyman of Lexington. The argument
for the Old Church of England attracted his attention.
He perused and studied it fully, sent for all the available
authorities on the subject; studied them with such
effect that at once he changed his communion to the
Episcopal Church and was ever after a rigid and zealous
pillar to that church, and an industrious student of the
writings of the theological fathers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>His logic, on which he based his medical theory and
practice, is most elaborately set forth in his only large
work, already mentioned&mdash;<i>A Treatise of Pathology and
Therapeutics</i>&mdash;and was tersely summed up by a most
zealous believer and pupil of his<a name="FNanchor_52_64" id="FNanchor_52_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_64" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> as follows: "If all
diseases result from congestion of the <i>vena cava</i>, and if
calomel is the best and most reliable remedy, what is
the use of applying to any other means?"</p>

<p>Because of its simplicity and its apparently logical
basis, the system of Doctor Cooke was very attractive
to students of medicine. If true&mdash;and they could not
doubt it&mdash;it was a great new discovery of a royal road
to medical practice which avoided all the drudgery over
pathology, chemistry, the materia medica and therapeutics
of the old school. All ordinary diseases were a
unit produced by a common cause, and calomel was the
principal panacea!</p>

<p>But alas! the logical system of Doctor Cooke, like
many other beautiful and well-laid superstructures, failed
in this essential thing&mdash;<i>the foundation on which it was
raised was not true</i>.</p>

<p>Logical minds too often willingly lay down or accept
assumptions, or uncertain facts, as axioms, and are satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
if the deductions from these are logically accurate
and perfect. Doctor Cooke, in a slow and laborious
way, took infinite pains to build up his logical superstructure.
The writer recollects his illustration of logical
connections, by means of certain pieces of wood united
by strings; and, notwithstanding his unadorned style
and slow and hesitating manner, his students&mdash;carried
away by his well-known truthfulness, sincerity, and
earnest zeal, and incapable of judging for themselves of
the validity of his premises&mdash;accepted his doctrine as a
new revelation and were almost unanimously his ardent
followers until experience or more ample knowledge opened
their eyes to its faults.</p>

<p>Before he removed from Transylvania School to the
new one in Louisville in 1837, severe criticisms of his
teachings had been published. Indeed it had begun to
be believed by some that these teachings were marring
the prosperity of that old college. Soon after his removal
to Louisville, we are told by Doctor Yandell, "the current
which from the first had set in against his theory and
practice grew every year more formidable" until "assailed
on all sides, and from within as well as from without,
his theory steadily lost ground, his practice grew more
unpopular and his influence as a teacher visibly declined
from the day he began to lecture in Louisville."<a name="FNanchor_53_65" id="FNanchor_53_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_65" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
that in 1843 he was, on petition of the students, retired
on a three years' pension of two thousand dollars per
annum.</p>

<p>Besides the two volumes of his <i>Pathology and Therapeutics</i>
he published a small work on <i>Autumnal Diseases</i>,
and a number of medical papers in <i>The Transylvania
Journal of Medicine</i>, of which he was one of
the original editors. The congestive theory of disease
had its short day, like many others which have floated
like bubbles on the stream of medical progress. We
remember it as one of the curiosities of medical literature.<a name="FNanchor_54_66" id="FNanchor_54_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_66" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Doctor Charles Wilkins Short</span></h4>

<p>Was born in Woodford County, Kentucky, at "Greenfields,"
October 6, 1794. He connected himself with the
Medical Department of Transylvania University in 1825.
He had been called by the Trustees in a previous year
to the chair of Materia Medica and Medical Botany, but
did not at once accept.</p>

<p>Doctor Short was a most upright, conscientious,
modest, undemonstrative gentleman of great delicacy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
feeling. He was a most zealous and industrious botanist,
and was possessed of artistic tastes and ability.</p>

<p>One of his greatest pleasures was in his extensive
herbarium, rich with the native plants of Kentucky collected
by himself, as well as with those from other regions
obtained by the exchange of specimens with the various
botanists of the world, with whom he corresponded individually
and extensively. He, in conjunction with Professors
H. H. Eaton, H. A. Griswold, and R. Peter, contributed
to the <i>Transylvania Journal of Medicine</i> several
papers on the plants of Kentucky,<a name="FNanchor_55_67" id="FNanchor_55_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_67" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and wrote for that
periodical several papers on this subject and on medical
topics, as well as numerous obituary notices of medical
men. He was not the author of any large treatise.</p>

<p>In addition to his notices and catalogues of Kentucky
plants he published in the <i>Transylvania Medical
Journal</i>:</p>

<p>"Instructions for Gathering and Preservation of Plants
in Herbaria."</p>

<p>"Botanical Bibliography." 1835.</p>

<p>"A Brief Historical Sketch of the Origin and Progress
of Cholera Asphyxia." 1835.</p>

<p>"A Sketch of the Progress of Botany in Western
America."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>In 1845, he wrote "Observations of the Botany of
Illinois," published in the <i>Western Journal of Medicine
and Surgery</i>.</p>

<p>In the early volumes of the <i>Transylvania Journal</i>
also appeared his notices of two remarkable cases which
occurred in Lexington. One, of supposed <i>spontaneous
combustion of the human body</i>, and the other of <i>paralysis
of the kidneys</i>.</p>

<p>At his death his vast collection of botanical specimens,
in the formation of which he took such delight,
and to which he had devoted so great a portion of his
life, was bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution at
Washington, but there was no appropriate place there
in which to display so large a collection. It is now in
possession of the Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia.
During his life no less than five of the distinguished
botanists of the age honored his name by
attaching it to six new genera and species of plants.</p>

    <p class="caption">DOCTOR CHARLES WILKINS SHORT.</p>
</div>

<p>His lectures to the medical students on Materia Medica
and Medical Botany he always read from his manuscript,
which detracted somewhat from his impressiveness. He
was too modest to trust himself to oral discourses.<a name="FNanchor_56_68" id="FNanchor_56_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_68" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
his pupils were always closely attentive and respectful,
holding him and his teachings in high esteem.<a name="FNanchor_57_69" id="FNanchor_57_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_69" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>He was Dean of the Medical Faculty in Transylvania
for about ten years.</p>

<p>For some years he was co-editor of the <i>Transylvania
Journal of Medicine</i> with Doctor Cooke. This quarterly
they founded in Lexington in 1828.</p>

<p>Doctor Short severed his connection with the Transylvania
Medical School in 1838 to be allied with Doctors
Caldwell, Cooke, and Yandell in the Medical Institute
of Louisville,<a name="FNanchor_58_70" id="FNanchor_58_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_70" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> in which he remained until 1849, when his
colleagues elected him Emeritus Professor of Materia
Medica and Botany. He died at his beautiful country
residence, "Hayfield," near Louisville, on March 7, 1863,
aged sixty-nine years.</p>

<p>Doctor Short's father was Peyton Short, who came
to Kentucky from Surry County, Virginia, and whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Skipwith,
Baronet. His mother was Mary, daughter of John Cleves
Symmes, formerly of Long Island, who filled various
offices of honor and trust in Cincinnati. His sister was
the wife of Doctor Benjamin Winslow Dudley. His
brother was the late Judge John Cleves Short, of North
Bend, Ohio. He married Mary Henry Churchill, only
daughter of Armistead and Jane Henry Churchill. Of
his six children&mdash;one son and five daughters&mdash;all were
prosperous in life.</p>

<p>The early education of Doctor Short was in the school
of the celebrated Joshua Fry, and, in 1810, he graduated
with honor in the Academical Department of Transylvania
University, beginning soon afterward the study
of medicine with his uncle, Professor Frederick Ridgely.
He repaired to Philadelphia in 1813 and became a private
pupil of Doctor Casper Wistar, Professor of Anatomy
in the University of Pennsylvania, in which university
Doctor Short received the degree of Doctor of Medicine
in the spring of 1815, returning shortly after to Kentucky.
Doctor Short was a consistent member of the
Presbyterian church.<a name="FNanchor_59_71" id="FNanchor_59_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_71" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Professor Lunsford Pitts Yandell, Senior, M. D.</span></h4>

<p>Was called to the chair of Chemistry and Pharmacy in
the Medical Department of Transylvania University,
March 16, 1831.<a name="FNanchor_60_72" id="FNanchor_60_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_72" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> He had attended the course of lectures
in that school in 1822&ndash;23, having previously acquired
a good general and classical education in the Bradley
Academy, Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and having studied
medicine some time with his father, Doctor Wilson Yandell,
a physician of high standing.</p>

<p>While attending the lectures in the Transylvania
Medical College he became favorably known as a young
man of industry, good attainments, and ability, and of
popular manners. Especially was he a favorite pupil of
Professor Charles Caldwell, who became his ardent friend,
and through whose active influence, mainly, he was called
in 1831&mdash;after he had received the degree of M. D. from
the University of Maryland&mdash;to occupy the Chemical
chair in the Transylvania School.</p>

<p>Although he had been a good and apt scholar in his
preliminary education, he had never devoted especial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
attention to chemistry, which at that time, notwithstanding
the neglect or opposition of the older medical
teachers&mdash;notably the ridicule of Professor Caldwell and
others&mdash;was beginning to be recognized as an essential
element of a good medical education.</p>

<p>This want of special training and experience in this
branch of science on his part naturally caused opposition
to his appointment to this chair, which was allayed
by making the late Hezekiah Hulbert Eaton, A. M.,
professor adjunct to the Chemical chair, and giving him
one third of the tuition fees.</p>

<p>Professor Eaton was a young man of fine attainments
and thorough practical training in chemistry and natural
science generally; a graduate of Rensselaer Institute of
Troy, New York, under the administration of his father,
the celebrated Amos Eaton.<a name="FNanchor_61_73" id="FNanchor_61_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_73" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Adjunct Professor Eaton died of consumption at the
age of twenty-three, before the end of the first year; but
during the short term of his service he had, by his industry
and practical knowledge, greatly improved the means
of instruction in the Chemical Department by a complete
reorganization of the laboratory and the procurement
of much new apparatus, etc.<a name="FNanchor_62_74" id="FNanchor_62_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_74" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

    <p class="caption">DOCTOR LUNSFORD P. YANDELL, SENIOR.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>After the death of Professor Eaton, August 16, 1832,
the present writer, then residing in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania,
who had also been a student in the Rensselaer
Institute and consequently known to Professor Eaton,
was persuaded by the late Reverend Benjamin Orr Peers
to visit Lexington, Kentucky, to deliver a course of
chemical lectures in the Eclectic Institute, of which Mr.
Peers was principal and of which young Professor Eaton
had been a professor. During this course, in 1832, the
writer was induced by Professor Yandell, by private
arrangement, to assist him in his next course of lectures
to the medical students of Transylvania and to commence
the regular study of medicine with a view to
graduation.</p>

<p>Under this arrangement, which continued until the
disruption of the Medical Faculty in 1837, Doctor Yandell,
in his usual able and brilliant manner, delivered the
chemical lectures to the students, while to the writer
was committed the preparation and performance of the
demonstrative experimental part.</p>

<p>On his removal to Louisville in 1837, to join in the
establishment of the rival school, the Louisville Medical
Institute, Doctor Yandell taught in the combined chairs
of Chemistry and Materia Medica, never failing ably
and impressively to perform this arduous duty. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
having any particular taste for so severe a study as practical
chemistry, although no one was more impressed
with the philosophical beauty and wide practical value
of the science, he naturally sought a transfer to a chair
more congenial with his tastes and the character of his
mind than that of chemistry. This, circumstances prevented
until, in 1849, the Trustees of the school&mdash;having
come to the conclusion that Professor Caldwell had
become superannuated&mdash;placed Doctor Yandell in the
chair of Physiology, for which subject he had a decided
taste. This change procured him the animosity of his
whilom friend, Doctor Caldwell, who, in his rather unfortunate
<i>Autobiography</i> written in his last declining
years, indulged in much bitter denunciation of his late
colleague. It is much to the credit of Doctor Yandell
that, although when this angry publication was fresh
from the press he retaliated by showing in ample quotations
from the <i>Autobiography</i> some of the weak points
in Doctor Caldwell's character, he was disposed in following
years, as the writer knows, to extend over these
weaknesses the mantle of kindness.</p>

<p>Doctor Yandell occupied this chair of Physiology
with great credit until he resigned, in 1859, to accept a
chair in the Medical School of Memphis, Tennessee.
During the Civil War he devoted himself to hospital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
service. In 1862, he was licensed to preach by the Presbytery
of Memphis, and in 1864 was ordained pastor
of the Dancyville Presbyterian church. He resigned his
pastorship in 1867, and returned to Louisville to resume
the practice of medicine, which he had never entirely
abandoned during the whole of his professional life.</p>

<p>While resident in Lexington he was for some years
sole editor of the <i>Transylvania Journal of Medicine</i>, to
which he contributed several able papers. In Louisville
he was editor for some time of the <i>Western Journal of
Medicine and Surgery</i>, in both cases filling the editorial
chair with characteristic activity and ability. He was
always a contributor to the medical literature of his day
in numerous papers, especially in biographical sketches
and obituary memoirs of medical men of Kentucky and
Tennessee, a more complete collection of which he was
said to be preparing at the time of his last illness. He
held a facile pen; few writers of our times have produced
more classical and graceful essays. As a public
speaker and lecturer he was ever impressive, graceful,
and chaste. His social qualities made him always welcome
and prominent in all public assemblies of his medical
brethren. In 1872, he was elected President of the
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Louisville, and
at the time of his death he was President of the Medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Society of Kentucky. His decease occurred February
4, 1878, in the seventy-third year of his age.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Doctor Robert Peter</span>,</h4>

<p>Though of foreign birth, came of that same class of
British ancestry which has given the United States her
representative Americans, Virginia her great men, our
own State her typical Kentuckians. Born at Launceston,
Cornwall, January 21, 1805, he was a member of the
Peter family of Devon and Essex, which produced in
former times the remarkable Sir William Peter or Petre,
to which has been ascribed the noted Hugh Peter or
Peters, and from which collaterally are descended the
present Lords Bathurst and Petre. Robert Peter came
to America with his parents, Robert and Johanna Dawe
Peter, and their six other children, when twelve years
old, landing at Baltimore and later settling at Pittsburg,
Pennsylvania. The father, it seems, succeeded in none
of his money-making enterprises in the new country,
and Robert had early to support himself and to contribute
something to the maintenance of the family. He
was placed in Charles Avery's wholesale drug store at
Pittsburg and there received a first-rate business education,
while diligently cultivating his decided taste for
chemistry. In 1828, he became a naturalized citizen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the United States. The same year, after attending one
session (by especial request) at the Rensselaer Institute
Scientific School at Troy, New York, he acquired the
title of "Lecturer on the Natural Sciences,"<a name="FNanchor_63_75" id="FNanchor_63_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_75" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and delivered
a course of chemical lectures to a small class in
Pittsburg, was a member of the Hesperian Society and
contributed to its organ, <i>The Hesperus</i>, numerous papers,
scientific, literary, and poetical. In 1829, as member
of the Pittsburg Philosophical Society, he gave a
course of lectures on the Natural Sciences before that
Society. In 1830&ndash;31, he lectured on Chemistry in the
Western University of Pennsylvania. In 1832, he came
to Lexington, Kentucky, somewhat reluctantly, at the
urgent insistence of Reverend Benjamin O. Peers, to be
associated with him in the proprietorship of his "Eclectic
Institute," at that place, and to deliver a course of lectures
in the Institute.<a name="FNanchor_64_76" id="FNanchor_64_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_76" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>While thus engaged, Professor Peter was induced by
Doctor Yandell, Professor of Chemistry, to accept the
duties of adjunct to the chair of Chemistry, a position
made vacant by the death of Professor H. H. Eaton,
August 16, 1832.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>On March 16, 1833, he was unanimously elected to
the chair of Chemistry in Morrison College, Transylvania
University, being installed on the occasion of the dedication
of that college, November 4, 1833, when the oath
of office was administered to Mr. Peers as Proctor of
Morrison College and President <i>pro tem.</i> of the University.
Professor Peter then studied medicine in Transylvania,
receiving his diploma March 18, 1834. He was
present during the terrible epidemic of cholera in Lexington
in 1833, and with Doctor Yandell attended the
first case&mdash;that of a Mr. Henry. Though a successful
practitioner, Doctor Peter, like Doctor Short, had a distaste
for the life of a physician, and soon retired to more
congenial scientific labors. On October 6, 1835, he married
Frances Paca, eldest daughter of Major William
S. Dallam. In 1838,<a name="FNanchor_65_77" id="FNanchor_65_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_77" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> he was elected to the chair of
Chemistry and Pharmacy in Transylvania Medical Department,
and, until the close of the school in 1857, was honorably
connected with it. From 1847 to the end, in 1857,
he was chosen Dean of the Faculty, being Librarian as
well. In 1839, with Doctor James M. Bush, Doctor Peter
spent most of the summer in London and Paris purchasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
books, apparatus, and other means of instruction
for the Medical Department.<a name="FNanchor_66_78" id="FNanchor_66_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_78" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> After hearing numerous
lectures by famous doctors, and after visiting the model
hospitals, etc., of the day, he writes to his wife (Paris,
June 27, 1839): "We can have as great men [in Lexington]
as either of those cities [London and Paris], and
neither of them contains a man as eminent in surgery
as Doctor Dudley"; and from London, August 11, 1839:
"We have bought a great many fine books and a great
deal of excellent apparatus and anatomical and other
models. Transylvania will shine. No other institution
in our part of the world will be able to compare with
her in the means of instruction. In fact, I have seen
none in Europe that is more completely prepared to
teach <i>modern</i> medicine."<a name="FNanchor_67_79" id="FNanchor_67_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_79" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Daguerre, in 1839, had just published the process of
his wonderful art, and it constituted perhaps the greatest
novelty in Paris at the time of the sojourn there of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Doctor Bush and Doctor Peter; so along with the
apparatus for Transylvania was brought to Lexington a
daguerreotype outfit which surely must have been the
first ever seen in that city, if not the first ever used in
the West. This primitive camera and its accompaniments,
which Doctor Peter showed to his classes many
years after, can still be found, it is supposed, among the
old Transylvania possessions preserved at the Kentucky
University.</p>

<p>On his return from Europe Doctor Peter engaged in
much valuable chemical research for the benefit of medical
science, notably his examinations of calculi, published
in 1846.<a name="FNanchor_68_80" id="FNanchor_68_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_80" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> He also, in 1846, experimented with the
then newly discovered explosive, gun-cotton, and with
pyroxyline made from paper and other materials. His
chemical research and teachings all were now and invariably
along practical lines. Leaving theory to others, his
own endeavors were in anticipation of useful results in
practice. Quick to adopt new views when properly
sustained by facts, he was highly appreciative of improved
methods, a trait strikingly displayed when, in his old
age, the most radical changes revolutionized the methods
of chemical work. Laying aside the long-familiar doctrines,
practiced since his far-distant youth, he took up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the new with an ease&mdash;even alacrity&mdash;hardly excelled
by contemporary chemists of a younger generation. In
his early days he experimented much with electricity&mdash;then
little understood. He gave much attention to
geology, mineralogy, zoology, and botany. Associated
with Doctor Charles W. Short and Professor Henry A.
Griswold, he made important botanical explorations.<a name="FNanchor_69_81" id="FNanchor_69_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_81" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
His fine herbarium, including specimens exchanged for
with leading European botanists, he gave in after years to
the Kentucky State Agricultural and Mechanical College.
Doctor Lewis Rogers, in his address as President to the
Kentucky State Medical Society, 1878, says: "In the
interesting departments of Botany and Chemistry, Doctor
Charles Wilkins Short and Doctor Peter are known
throughout the scientific world. As teachers, the modest,
almost shrinking manner, the seemingly acerb dignity,
and Addisonian style of the one and the lucid expositions
and brilliant illustrations of the other, must be
remembered by all who ever listened to them." In
1850&ndash;53, Doctor Peter filled with distinction the chair
of Chemistry in the newly founded Kentucky School
of Medicine at Louisville, since so successful. On October
19, 1853, at the third meeting of the Kentucky Medical
Society at Lexington, he proposed to memorialize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the legislature in regard to the establishment of a Geological
Survey of Kentucky. Accordingly, he prepared
such a memorial (in connection with his "Report on
the Relation of Forms of Disease to the Geological Formation
of a Region"), accompanied by a geological map,
colored by himself.<a name="FNanchor_70_82" id="FNanchor_70_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_82" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> In consequence of this memorial,
which was unanimously sanctioned by the several agricultural
societies of the State, the first Geological Survey
of Kentucky&mdash;which was also the first large State enterprise
of the kind undertaken in the West&mdash;was begun
in 1854, under the able and experienced direction of
Doctor David Dale Owen. While chemist to this survey,
Doctor Peter demonstrated what previously he had sturdily
maintained and ably argued&mdash;that by soil analysis
could be determined the elements necessary to increase
and preserve the fertility of soils.<a name="FNanchor_71_83" id="FNanchor_71_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_83" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> He was probably
the first in America to apply quantitative and qualitative
analysis in this manner&mdash;certainly the first to apply
it to any great extent. He proved by numerous analyses
that chemical analysis as practiced by him was capable
of showing the deterioration of soils by long cultivation.
He did this by comparing the composition of the virgin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
soil with that of soil taken from a near-by old field.<a name="FNanchor_72_84" id="FNanchor_72_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_84" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
The amount of chemical work accomplished by Doctor
Peter in the Kentucky Survey seems wellnigh impossible
when it is considered that at the same time he lectured
daily six times a week in two colleges&mdash;never omitting
to prepare experiments in illustration of his subject.
Some Eastern chemists were actually disposed to dispute
the facts. One of these asserted that "no chemist
could make more than one soil analysis in less than a
month." Doctor Owen says in this regard: "Without
a knowledge of the peculiar circumstances under which
the work was performed, the amount of Doctor Peter's
chemical labor during the last six years, as chemical
assistant to the Survey of Kentucky, might appear incredible,
for he has, in fact, performed a greater number of
<i>reliable</i>, <i>detailed</i>, <i>practically useful</i> analyses of soils than
any living chemist"<a name="FNanchor_73_85" id="FNanchor_73_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_85" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>&mdash;which comes with authority, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Doctor Owen, a man not given to exaggeration, was in
position to view the whole field, and as Director fully
and faithfully informed himself as to what was going on
all over the world in matters relating to his department.
Doctor Owen said no chemists in this country had thought
proper to turn their special attention to soil analysis,
but that Doctor Peter, with the help of only one assistant
to do the more mechanical part of the work, had
in six years of the survey made one thousand, one hundred
and twenty-six quantitative analyses, three hundred
and seventy-five of which were of soils in which,
on an average, twelve different substances were determined.
In addition to this and the preparation of his
own chemical report, Doctor Peter personally supervised
the publication of the four royal 8vo volumes of this
Survey, reading and correcting all proof and adding an
obituary biographical sketch of his friend Doctor Owen,
whose death, November 13, 1860, had terminated the
survey. Before arrangements could be made to continue
this important public work the Civil War intervened,
putting a stop to all such beneficent pursuits. Doctor
Peter unhesitatingly and warmly upheld his adopted
country against secession. Unable to take the field with
his friend, Ethelbert Dudley, he promptly fell into the
ranks of Dudley's Home Guards, shoulder to shoulder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
with Benjamin Gratz, Madison C. Johnson, David A.
Sayre, and other such fellow-citizens.<a name="FNanchor_74_86" id="FNanchor_74_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_86" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> He was appointed
Acting Assistant Surgeon in charge of Military Hospitals
at Lexington, Kentucky, being most of the time senior
surgeon in charge, quickly bringing his hospitals to a
high state of order and efficiency. It was this gift of
reducing to system, combined with untiring energy and
diligence, which in his long life tended to make all his
work both rapid and successful. Thus he carried on
simultaneously numbers of analyses with immense saving
of time, while other chemists went through each operation
separately&mdash;making his results almost beyond belief.
When, after the war, the survey was resumed under Professor
N. S. Shaler, Doctor Peter prepared three chemical
reports of his analytical work, 1873&ndash;78. A total of four
hundred and seventy-seven pages, containing eight hundred
and seventy-one analyses.</p>

<p>In the survey continued under the late John R.
Procter, he prepared six reports, five of which were published,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
covering five hundred and eighty-eight pages,
describing nine hundred and seventy-seven analyses&mdash;a
total of one thousand, eight hundred and forty-eight
published analyses. The sixth report&mdash;the ninth of the
new survey&mdash;made to Procter, was not published for
the lack of funds, and the manuscript seems to have
been lost. The analyses, of which there are about four
hundred, will be published, however, by the present able
director of the newly resumed Geological Survey, Professor
C. J. Norwood, in as nearly the original form as
can be restored from the records. Thus, with the one
assistant, Doctor Peter made for the new survey about
two thousand, two hundred and fifty analyses. Besides
which, during his active life in Lexington, he had at all
times considerable practice as consulting and analytical
chemist, making for individuals many analyses not
included in the above. As a toxicologist he had a high
reputation, and his expert testimony usually carried the
day in cases wherein he was called. At the time of the
First Kentucky Survey, under Doctor Owen, Doctor
Peter had also contributed to the second report of a
Geological Reconnoissance of the Southern and Middle
Counties of Arkansas, made during the years 1859 and
1860, an octavo volume of four hundred and thirty-three
pages, in which he gives the history of two hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
seventy-one chemical analyses made by himself of soils,
subsoils, under-clays, nitre-earths, etc., of Arkansas, with
remarks in one hundred and twenty-five pages of report.
At the same time he made chemical analyses of thirty-three
soils, subsoils, etc., of the State of Indiana for the
survey of that State begun by Doctor D. D. Owen and
continued, on Doctor Owen's death, by his brother,
Colonel Richard Owen. It will be seen by reference
to the Kentucky Geological Reports that Doctor Peter
was the first, or among the first, to point out the fact
that the lower Silurian limestones always contain a notable
quantity of phosphates, and that this circumstance
in part accounts for the richness of our bluegrass soils<a name="FNanchor_75_87" id="FNanchor_75_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_87" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>&mdash;facts
which he brought to the attention of the agricultural
public as early as April, 1849, in the <i>Albany
Cultivator</i>, of New York.</p>

<p>He was apparently the first to show that some of the
upper layers of the Trenton limestone are remarkably
rich in phosphates, as shown by his analyses published
in the reports cited.</p>

<p>In 1865, when in accordance with Honorable John
B. Bowman's lofty educational plans Kentucky University
was removed to Lexington, was united with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Transylvania, and included the State Agricultural and
Mechanical College, Doctor Peter occupied the chair of
Chemistry and Experimental Philosophy in the new
University, lecturing daily in two colleges, having declined
the Presidency of the Agricultural and Mechanical College,
which was offered him by Regent Bowman. At this
period he devoted his every energy of mind and body
to assist in the upbuilding of what he fondly hoped would
be the great educational institution of the West and
South; for the training especially of Kentucky's youth
of every rank and creed, and for the benefit of all men
of all nations who sought knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_76_88" id="FNanchor_76_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_88" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> He accepted
and accomplished, it was said at the time, the work of
three average men. On the separation of the State College
from the Kentucky University, after a bitter sectarian
controversy in which he manfully defended the
Transylvania trusts&mdash;little understood by some of the
controversialists&mdash;he remained with the State College at
the head of the Chemical Department.<a name="FNanchor_77_89" id="FNanchor_77_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_89" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>In 1887, Doctor Peter was made Emeritus Professor of
Chemistry in the State College. It would be of interest
to give a detailed account of Doctor Peter's writings,
but this must of necessity be reserved for a more extended
biography. He was an easy, practical, and prolific writer
on a large range of subjects. Deeply interested in agriculture
and horticulture, he prepared many able treatises
for journals of these branches. He experimented for
himself in the culture of fruits and flowers&mdash;notably in
grape-culture and wine-making. In 1867&ndash;68, he assisted
in editing the <i>Farmer's Home Journal</i>, a weekly published
at Lexington, Kentucky, and until its discontinuance&mdash;well
in the seventies&mdash;he contributed many
articles. He was sole editor of the tenth volume of the
<i>Transylvania Journal of Medicine</i>, and in the preceding
and following volumes published a number of contributions
on medical and scientific themes. He took an
active part with his pen in the controversy which arose
on the attempted removal to Louisville of the Transylvania
Medical School by some of the Transylvania
professors and the establishment at Louisville of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
"Medical Institute" as a rival school.<a name="FNanchor_78_90" id="FNanchor_78_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_90" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Like Doctor
B. W. Dudley, Doctor Peter, under a misapprehension
of the facts, was at first inclined to sanction the removal
of the medical school to Louisville, for he says in a
"Narrative" of the controversy published in the <i>Lexington
Intelligencer</i>, July 7, 1837: "I was in favor of
the removal of the Transylvania Medical School when I
believed it was to be done with the consent of its legal
guardians, and with the certainty of very liberal endowments,
which would increase its means of instruction;
but when the bubble burst&mdash;when it was found that
the name of Transylvania, the oath of office&mdash;<i>principle</i>,
in fact, were all to be sacrificed to the splendid scheme&mdash;I
drew back." And from listening to Doctor Caldwell's
flattering offers of emoluments in Louisville&mdash;even
to the promise that Doctor Peter should have the superintendence
of the erection of the chemical laboratory&mdash;he
joined Dudley in maintaining the Transylvania School
at Lexington, vigorously defending Dudley, and himself
also, against the attacks of the Caldwell faction. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
midst of the general hostility, Doctor Peter became antagonistic
to his former friend, Doctor Yandell&mdash;indeed,
bitter was the strife on all hands. But in after years,
when the better part of half a century had rolled between,
Doctor Peter, on the friendly advance of Doctor Yandell,
forgot the vindictive feeling of the past and a correspondence
both pleasant and profitable sprung up between
the two old men, which was maintained until the death
of Doctor Yandell. Doctor Yandell confessed that in
the heat of contention he had said much which afterward
he fain would recall. And it is readily to be
credited that others felt the same when time was given
for calm and dispassionate reflection.</p>

<p>Doctor Peter at all times wrote much on education,
much on politics and the questions of the day. Beside
lectures to his classes, he gave by request many public
lectures on various topics. Possessing no especial gift
of voice or enunciation, he was not an orator, though
as a lecturer uniformly popular; never dry, though full
of information; sometimes humorous, but ever dignified.
He never neglected, where appropriate, to illustrate his
subject with experiments, frequently new and always
skillfully performed. His rapidity and sureness of manipulation
were nearly that of the prestidigitator, and were
the boast and admiration of his pupils. But with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
complete mastery of science there was no corresponding
lack of business ability. More than once he was
offered civic honors&mdash;vainly, however. Once he agreed to
act as City Councilman, but summarily resigned because
the Council unjustly denied to respectable colored citizens
the right to establish a public school for negroes in Lexington&mdash;a
refusal we can not understand to-day. He
was ever ready to give time, labor, and money to public
education and improvement; ready instantly to take up
his pen on all questions affecting the welfare of the community
in which he lived, regardless of applause, yet
valuing the approval of the wise and good. His modesty
was inherent. He utterly abhorred ostentation. Yet no
citizen was better known, or could more surely rely upon
the love and respect of his fellows&mdash;respect secured by
thorough truthfulness and honesty of purpose&mdash;the "courage
of his convictions" which never left him. He retained
his activity of mind and body, his youthful appearance,
his cheerfulness of spirit, up to a very short time before
his death, which took place at "Winton," eight miles
from Lexington, in the eighty-ninth year of his age, April
26, 1894. He had, as he had often wished, "worn out
rather than rusted out."</p>

<p>Perhaps the words of his colleague of more than twenty
years make the best summary of his life and character:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
"Intense devotion to physical science and work of the
laboratory, purity of speech and modesty of manner,
fidelity to all duties, domestic, professional, and civic,
fidelity to settled convictions and principles; above all,
his long and illustrious career in educating so many
thousands of the young, and in setting before them a
model so worthy of their imitation and remembrance;
these were the traits, this was the service that crowned
his busy life of nearly ninety years with honor, admiration,
and renown."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Professor James Conquest Cross, M. D.</span></h4>

<p>Born in the vicinity of Lexington, Kentucky, was early
distinguished for superior natural energy and mental
ability. He was a graduate of Transylvania and most
ambitious to take place as member of its Faculty. Appointed
to the chair of Institutes of Medicine in 1837,
having been called from the Medical College of Ohio, at
Cincinnati, where he held a professorship, he occupied
the position in Lexington until 1843&ndash;44, and died a few
years thereafter. He was Dean of the Medical Faculty
in 1838.</p>

<p>Doctor Cross contributed several papers to the medical
journals, but wrote no large work. He was distinguished
for readiness and brilliancy rather than for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
solidity. His strong ambition and self-confidence, with
his considerable abilities and extensive reading, gave
promise of a most distinguished career, which unhappily
a certain want of mental ballast measurably prevented.<a name="FNanchor_79_91" id="FNanchor_79_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_91" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Doctor John Eberle</span><a name="FNanchor_80_92" id="FNanchor_80_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_92" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></h4>

<p>Was a native of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and
was a little over fifty years of age at the time of his
decease. Born and educated among the Germans of
Lancaster, he retained the peculiar accent and idiom
of that people to the day of his death, as also their habits
of industry and perseverance in favorite pursuits. At
an early period of his history, Doctor Eberle was deeply
involved in politics and for some time conducted a German
political paper. Prior to his removal to Philadelphia,
which occurred about the year 1818, he published
several interesting papers in the <i>New York Medical
Repository</i> and other journals. Shortly after his settlement
in Philadelphia, he became the editor of the <i>American
Medical Recorder</i>, known throughout the country
as one of our ablest periodicals. In 1822, his work on
<i>Therapeutics and Materia Medica</i> first appeared, after
having encountered many obstacles that for a time seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to preclude its publication. The author assured the
writer of this notice that he failed in all his attempts
to procure a publisher, who would give him anything
for the copyright, until the person who finally became
its proprietor offered two hundred and fifty dollars for
the work. Being the first book of the author, he accepted
the offer in the hope of being more successful in his subsequent
undertakings.</p>

<p>In 1824, on the establishment of Jefferson Medical
College, Doctor Eberle constituted one of its Faculty,
and continued in the school until his removal to Cincinnati
in 1831. While in Jefferson he taught the Theory
and Practice, Materia Medica, and Obstetrics at different
periods, and was also engaged as editor of the <i>American
Medical Review</i>, a journal devoted especially to the interests
of that school. While in the Jefferson Faculty he
published the first edition of his work on <i>Practice</i>, which,
it is well known, has passed through several editions,
and unlike its predecessor yielded a handsome compensation
to its author.</p>

<p>In 1831, Doctor Eberle was invited (in connection
with Doctors Thomas D. Mitchell and George McClellan)
by Doctor Drake, to unite in the formation of a new
medical school at Cincinnati. In the winter of 1831&ndash;32,
the deceased gave his first course of lectures in the West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
as Professor of Materia Medica and Medical Botany in
the Medical College of Ohio, in which school he remained
until the fall of 1837, when he became connected with the
Medical Department of Transylvania. While in Cincinnati,
he prepared his work on the <i>Diseases of Children</i>,
for which the publishers gave him a fair compensation,
and it is understood that he was engaged a year ago in
getting ready for the press <i>A System of Midwifery</i>. That
he was importuned by his publishers in Ohio to prepare
such a work is known to the writer of this notice.</p>

<p>In addition to the publications of Doctor Eberle above
named, there were others of less magnitude. Among
these we name a small work of a botanical character,
for young students; and it may be noticed here that
botany was a favorite study with the deceased.</p>

<p>Doctor Eberle was not fond of the practice of his profession,
or he might have become rich in its pursuit. He
was devoted especially to books, and as a journalist he
has not perhaps been equaled in the United States of
America. In his deportment he was plain, unassuming,
unostentatious; and his whole aspect was indicative of
one who had long been a companion of the midnight
lamp. Few there are in our profession whose labors
have given them such extensive celebrity as fell to the
lot of Professor Eberle. His <i>Practice of Physic</i> is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
almost every medical library in the West, and has been
noticed with high commendation by foreign journalists.
His death has left a chasm in the profession, and especially
in the school of the West, that is greatly lamented.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Doctor Eberle died at Lexington, Kentucky, February
2, 1838, while filling the chair of the Theory and
Practice of Medicine.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Professor Thomas Duche Mitchell, M. D.</span>,</h4>

<p>Was appointed from the Medical College of Ohio to the
chair of Chemistry and Pharmacy in the Medical Department
of Transylvania in 1837. He was transferred to
that of Materia Medica and Medical Botany in the following
year, Doctor Peter having been called to the chair
of Chemistry, etc.</p>

<p>In consequence of the death of Professor John Eberle
early in the session of 1837&ndash;38, Doctor Mitchell was
required to fill both this and his own chair during the
session, an arduous duty which he performed faithfully
and to the satisfaction of all parties.<a name="FNanchor_81_93" id="FNanchor_81_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_93" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>With equal ability and success he performed a similar
double duty to the full satisfaction of his classes in the
winter of 1844&ndash;45, when, in consequence of the death of
Professor William H. Richardson, the chair of Obstetrics
and Diseases of Women and Children became vacant.
He was appointed to that chair. He was also Dean of
the Faculty in the Transylvania School from 1839 to
1846.</p>

<p>Doctor Mitchell was born in Philadelphia in 1791, in
which city for three generations his ancestors resided.
He died in the same city May 13, 1865, in his seventy-fourth
year, having heroically performed his duties as
Professor almost up to the time of his death, although he
was a constant sufferer from painful neuralgic disease of
the stomach, at times almost unendurable. His early
education was in Quaker schools, the best in those times
in that city, and in the University of Pennsylvania.
After a year spent in a drug store and chemical laboratory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
he became office pupil of the late Doctor Parrish,
and, after attendance on three full courses of medical
lectures in the Medical Department of the University,
he graduated in medicine. His thesis "On Acidification
and Combustion" was published in the Memoirs of the
Columbian Medical Society. His mind and pen always
in active operation, he published papers in <i>Coxe's Medical
Museum</i>, <i>New York Medical Repository</i>, <i>Duane's Portfolio</i>,
and other periodicals.</p>

<p>Early in 1812, he was appointed Professor of Vegetable
and Animal Physiology in Saint John's Lutheran
College, and, in the following year, as Lazaretto Physician,
which office he held for three years. In 1819, he published
a duodecimo volume on Medical Chemistry. From 1822
to 1831, he was actively engaged in medical practice at
Frankford, near Philadelphia. In 1826, he founded a
Total Abstinence Temperance Society, to the tenets of
which he rigidly adhered during the whole of his life,
deprecating the use of alcohol, even in the preparation
of the tinctures of the apothecary. He was also a strict
Presbyterian. In 1826, the honorary degree of A. M.
was conferred on him by the Trustees of Princeton College,
New Jersey.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1830&ndash;31, he was called to the chair
of Chemistry in the Miami University, and in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
summer to the same chair in the Medical College of
Ohio, at Cincinnati, which was soon thereafter amalgamated
with the Miami School, where he remained until
called to the same chair in the Medical Department of
Transylvania University in 1837. He was transferred,
as before mentioned, in the following year to the chair
of Materia Medica, Doctor Peter having been called to
that of Chemistry, etc. Here Doctor Mitchell continued
until the end of the session of 1848&ndash;49.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1847, the Philadelphia College of
Medicine held its first session, and Doctor Mitchell filled
in it the chair of Theory and Practice, Obstetrics, and
Medical Jurisprudence. In March, 1849, resigning his
chair in the Transylvania School, he joined himself with
the Philadelphia College with a view to a permanent
connection.</p>

<p>Declining tempting offers from medical schools in
Missouri and Tennessee, he, in 1852, resigned his chair
in Philadelphia and accepted that of Theory and Practice
of Medicine in the Kentucky School of Medicine at
Louisville. He performed the duties of that professorship
to the satisfaction of all parties until 1854, when
he resigned on account of ill health and returned to his
native city. Recovering, in a measure, his health, he
was chosen, without any movement on his part, to fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the chair of Materia Medica and General Therapeutics
in Jefferson Medical School of Philadelphia. This chair
he occupied up to the year of his death.</p>

<p>Doctor Mitchell was an able and indefatigable writer
and author. Without recurring to his earlier writings,
he published in 1832 an octavo volume of five hundred
and fifty-three pages, <i>On Chemical Philosophy</i>, on the
basis of <i>The Elements of Chemistry</i>, by Doctor Reid,
of Edinburgh. In the same year he produced his <i>Hints
to Students</i>, and acted as co-editor of the <i>Western Medical
Gazette</i> with Professors Eberle and Staughton; contributed
papers to the <i>New York Repository</i>, <i>Philadelphia
Museum</i>, <i>Western Journal of Medicine and Surgery</i>,

<h4><span class="smcap">James Mills Bush, M. D.</span>,</h4>

<p>A native of Kentucky,<a name="FNanchor_84_96" id="FNanchor_84_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_96" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> born in Frankfort May, 1808,
graduated as A. B. in Centre College, Danville, Kentucky,
and began the study of medicine and surgery in the office
of the celebrated Doctor Alban Goldsmith, Louisville,
Kentucky. He removed to Lexington in 1830&ndash;31, to
attend the medical lectures in Transylvania University,
and to become a private pupil of its renowned surgeon,
Professor Benjamin W. Dudley. To Doctor Dudley he
became personally attached by sentiments of affection
and esteem, which were warmly returned by his eminent
preceptor; so that, when young Bush received the honor
of the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1833, Doctor Dudley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
immediately appointed him his demonstrator and
prosector in Anatomy and Surgery, to which branches
of medical science and art Doctor Bush was ardently
devoted.</p>

<p>This responsible office he filled with eminent ability
and success until 1837, when he was officially made
Adjunct Professor of Anatomy and Surgery to his distinguished
colleague and friend, Doctor Dudley. He
occupied this honorable position to the great satisfaction
of all concerned until the year 1844, when he became
the Professor of Anatomy, Doctor Dudley retaining the
chair of Surgery. In the chair of Anatomy he continued
until the dissolution of the Transylvania Medical School
in 1857.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile this school, in 1850, had been
changed from a winter to a summer school; Doctor Bush,
with some of his colleagues and some physicians of Louisville,
having thought proper to establish the Kentucky
School of Medicine<a name="FNanchor_85_97" id="FNanchor_85_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_97" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> in Louisville as a winter school. In
this latter college Doctor Bush remained for three sessions&mdash;giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
thus two full courses of lectures per annum&mdash;when
he and his Lexington colleagues, resigning from
the Louisville school, returned to that of Lexington,
re-establishing a winter session.<a name="FNanchor_86_98" id="FNanchor_86_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_98" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Doctor Bush was ever a most conscientious and ardent
laborer in his profession, and, during the lifetime of his
preceptor, Doctor Dudley, was his constant associate and
assistant as well in the medical school as in his medical
and surgical practice. On the retirement of that distinguished
surgeon and professor, his mantle fell upon Doctor
Bush. In the language of his friend, the late Doctor
Lewis Rogers, in 1873: "When Doctor Dudley retired
from teaching, Doctor Bush was appointed to the vacant
chair. When Doctor Dudley retired from the field of
his brilliant achievements as a surgeon Doctor Bush had
the rare courage to take possession of it. No higher
tribute can be paid to him than to say that he has since
held possession without a successful rival."</p>

    <p class="caption">DOCTOR JAMES M. BUSH.<br />From a Photograph by Mullen.</p>
</div>

<p>Most ably and successfully did he thus maintain himself
as one fit to follow in the footsteps of our great surgeon.
His sterling qualities as a man, his most kind
and endearing manners as a physician, his great skill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and experience in anatomy and surgery, which had been
as well the pleasure as the devoted labor of his life; his
remarkable accuracy of eye, the more acute because of
congenital myopia, his delicacy of hand and unswerving
nerve in the use of instruments in the most difficult operations,
endeared him to his patients and won the respect
and admiration of his medical brethren.</p>

<p>Doctor Bush was a lucid and impressive teacher of
his peculiar branch of medical art and science, and always
attached his pupils strongly to him as an honored preceptor
and friend.</p>

<p>During his active lifetime, spent chiefly in acquiring
and putting in practice the rare professional skill which
distinguished him, he gave but little time to the use of
his pen. Hence he left no large book as the record of his
experience. His principal writings were published, in
1837, in the tenth volume of the <i>Transylvania Journal
of Medicine</i>, and these were written for that journal on
the solicitation of the present writer, who edited that
volume. They consist of:</p>

<p>1. A short report of a case of epilepsy, produced in a
negro girl by blows of the windlass of a well on the parietal
bone, which was entirely and speedily cured under
the preliminary treatment by Doctor Dudley of mercurial
purgatives and low diet, preparatory to the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
of the trephine, which, as is well known, had been used
with great success by Doctor Dudley in such cases.</p>

<p>2. Report of a case of insidious inflammation of the
pia mater, complicated with pleuritis&mdash;with the autopsy.</p>

<p>3. A more extended paper, entitled "Remarks on
Mechanical Pressure Applied by Means of the Bandage;
Illustrated by a Variety of Cases." In which the mode
of application and <i>modus operandi</i> are most clearly given,
and illustrated by many interesting cases, mostly from
the surgical practice of Doctor Dudley.</p>

<p>4. "Dissection of an Idiot's Brain." The subject&mdash;a
female twenty-five years of age&mdash;had been born idiotic,
blind, deaf, and dumb; the head was very small, and
the brain on dissection was found to weigh only twenty
ounces, and to have large serous cavities in the coronal
portions of the cerebral hemispheres. The anatomy of
the eyes was perfect, but there was no nervous connection
between the optic nerve and the <i>thalami nervorum
opticorum</i>.</p>

<p>5. A short notice of three operations of lithotomy,
performed on May 31, 1837, by Doctor Dudley, with his
assistance.</p>

<p>6. "Interesting Autopsy." On the body of a negro
man who had been the subject of sudden falling fits, and
was under treatment for disease of the chest. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
autopsy disclosed hypertrophy of the right side of the
heart, and a most remarkable course and lengthening
of the colon.</p>

<p>7. "Observations on the Operation of Lithotomy,
Illustrated by Cases from the Practice of Professor B.
W. Dudley." An extensive and lucid description of the
method of operation and the remarkably successful experience
of Doctor Dudley in this part of his practice, giving
report of one hundred and fifty-two successful cases up
to that time.</p>

<p>In addition, the Doctor contributed an occasional
bibliographical review or notice. And these seem to be
the whole of his published professional writings.</p>

<p>Doctor Bush was married, in 1835, to Miss Charlotte
James, of Chillicothe. Of their three children the eldest,
Benjamin Dudley, was a young man of remarkable
promise as a surgeon and physician when he was cut off,
an event which cast a gloom over the remaining days
of the life of his father. Few young men of his age had
ever attained such proficiency or developed such sterling
qualities.<a name="FNanchor_87_99" id="FNanchor_87_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_99" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>The death of Doctor Bush, which took place on February
14, 1875, was followed by general and unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
manifestations of respect and regret, not only on the
part of the members of the profession, but by the people
of the city at large. Few citizens were more extensively
known, loved, and honored in life or followed to the grave
by a greater concourse of mourning friends.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Nathan Ryno Smith, M. D.</span>,</h4>

<p>Was called from his residence in Baltimore, Maryland,
to the chair of Theory and Practice of Medicine in Transylvania
in the year 1838. He resigned the chair and
returned to that city in 1840, having delivered three
annual courses of lectures here. He was succeeded in
this chair by Doctor Elisha Bartlett.</p>

<p>Doctor Smith was born May 21, 1797, in the town of
Cornish, New Hampshire, where his father, Nathan Smith&mdash;afterward
Professor of Physic and Surgery in Yale
College&mdash;had been for ten years in the practice of his
profession. In a brief sketch of his father, Doctor Smith
unconsciously drew the outlines of his own character.
"In the practice of surgery," he said, "Professor Smith
displayed an original and inventive mind. His friends
claim for him the establishment of scientific principles
and the invention of resources in practice which will
stand as lasting monuments of a mind fertile in expedients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
and unshackled by the dogmas of the schools."
The father, at the age of twenty-four, after an early life
of industry and adventure in the then new country, had
been so impressed and attracted by witnessing a surgical
operation that he at once devoted himself to surgery
and medicine, and with such ardor and success that for
forty years succeeding he was a distinguished member
and teacher in his profession. The son, with much the
same natural bent of mind, after receiving his early education
at Dartmouth and graduating at Yale in 1817&mdash;spending
a year and a half in Virginia as a classical tutor&mdash;began
the study of medicine in Yale, where his father
was Professor of Physic and Surgery. He there received
the degree of Doctor of Medicine, in 1823. He began
practice in Burlington, Vermont, in 1824. In 1825, he
was appointed Professor of Surgery and Anatomy in the
University of Vermont, the Medical Department of which
was organized principally by his exertions, aided by his
father.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1825&ndash;26, he attended the medical lectures
in the University of Pennsylvania, with a view to
improvement in his profession and in the art of teaching
in it. While there he was invited by the late celebrated
surgeon, George McClellan&mdash;to whom he had become
favorably known&mdash;to take the chair of Anatomy in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
new Jefferson Medical College, which McClellan and other
members of the profession were engaged in organizing.
This situation he occupied with success for two years,
leaving it then to accept the chair of Anatomy in the
School of Medicine of the University of Maryland in
Baltimore, which had been vacated by Professor Granville
Sharpe Pattison, in 1827. In Baltimore he soon
acquired an extensive medical and surgical practice. On
the death of Professor John B. Davidge he was transferred
to the chair of Surgery. In the language of his
biographer and colleague, Samuel C. Chew, M. D.: "In
Baltimore he found a congenial home and when, at the
age of fourscore, he was laid to rest among us, his name
had been for a whole lifetime a household word throughout
our State."</p>

<p>When, in 1838, he accepted the inducement offered
him by the Medical Faculty of Transylvania University
to occupy the chair of the Theory and Practice of Medicine
in their college at Lexington, Kentucky,<a name="FNanchor_88_100" id="FNanchor_88_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_100" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
four months of the winter course of lectures, he did not
abandon his residence in Baltimore, but at the close of
each session returned to his professional work in that
city. It was there especially, as a professor and practitioner
of surgery, that his life-work was done.</p>

<p>Doctor Smith was a man of remarkable mental activity,
"acuteness of perception and extraordinary power
of adaptation to circumstances as they might arise,
promptness of action and untiring industry.... And yet
with his great gifts there was about him a remarkable
simplicity of character and a transparent ingenuousness
which was as incapable of affectation as of falsehood."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>His forte was Surgery, yet his lectures here on the
Theory and Practice of Medicine were exceedingly clear
and instructive. One little peculiarity of his may be
noticed. He never lectured without a small whalebone
rod or pointer. Without this in his hand he seemed
to fear the loss of continuity of his ideas. As remarked
by his biographer, "his wand must always be at hand,
for, like the magician's divining-rod, it seemed to
have some mystic connection with the exercise of
his powers."</p>

<p>Early in his professional life he published his work
on the <i>Anatomy of the Arteries</i>, and, in his later days,
his work on <i>Fractures of the Lower Extremities</i>. He
was engaged in the preparation of a work on surgery
at the time of his death. His inventive genius, which
was remarkable, was exhibited in several improvements
of the instruments and apparatus of surgery, especially
in his lithotome. In the practice of his son&mdash;Professor
Alan P. Smith&mdash;in a series of fifty-two consecutive cases,
without a single death, he used his father's lithotome in
all but six cases. This great success he attributed mainly
to the instrument. Another valuable improvement was
his "anterior splint."</p>

<p>Doctor Smith died on the third of July, 1877, a few
weeks after the completion of his eightieth year, full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
honors. "He has left behind him a record of a great
surgeon, a brave and true citizen and magnanimous
gentleman."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Elisha Bartlett, M. D., Etc.</span></h4>

<p>Born in Smithfield, Rhode Island, October 6, 1804.
His parents, Otis and Waite Bartlett, were highly respectable
members of the "Society of Friends." Their son,
whose early education was under the auspices of this
Society, possessed all the unostentatious virtues which
characterized that sect. At the "Friends' Institution"
in New York, under the celebrated teacher, Jacob Willett,
he obtained a highly finished classical education. He
subsequently attended medical lectures in Boston
and Providence and graduated as M. D. at Brown
University, Providence, in 1826. Soon after graduation
he spent a year pursuing medical studies under
distinguished professors in Paris, France, and in classical
Italy.</p>

<p>In 1836, he was elected as the first mayor of the town
of Lowell; was re-elected at the end of his first term,
and afterward, in 1840, was honored by election to the
Legislature of Massachusetts. A <i>statesman</i> and not a
<i>politician</i>, he soon abandoned political life for the more
congenial one of a medical teacher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
<a name="FNanchor_89_101" id="FNanchor_89_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_101" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>"In 1828, he was offered the chair of Anatomy in the
Medical School at Woodstock, Vermont, which honor he
declined.</p>

<p>"In 1832, he was appointed to a Professorship in the
Medical School at Pittsfield, Massachusetts, which he
held for several years. He also held a chair one year
in the Medical Department of Dartmouth College, and
for one year in Baltimore.</p>

<p>"In 1841, he was called to the chair of Theory and
Practice of Medicine in the Medical Department of Transylvania
University, which he occupied for three years
with ability and success."<a name="FNanchor_90_102" id="FNanchor_90_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_102" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>After a visit to Europe he again returned, in 1846,<a name="FNanchor_91_103" id="FNanchor_91_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_103" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
to the Transylvania Medical College, teaching in the same
chair for another three years.</p>

<p>"He subsequently delivered a course of medical lectures
in the Medical School at Louisville, giving also
summer lectures at Woodstock, Vermont, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
places&mdash;his instruction being highly appreciated by his
colleagues and most acceptable to his students.</p>

<p>"At length he was called to an important professorship
in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New
York. Here he continued for three years, when, compelled
by failing health, he abandoned the position to
retire to his paternal acres in Smithfield&mdash;to die, after
a long and lingering illness, on July 19, 1855."</p>

<p>His disease&mdash;partial paralysis of the lower extremities,
with torturing neuralgia and finally softening of the
brain, the result of lead poisoning, caused&mdash;as he believed,
and as he informed the writer&mdash;by the use of water which
had passed for a considerable distance through leaden
pipes.</p>

<p>The beautiful and sterling traits of the character of
Doctor Bartlett are most happily portrayed by the distinguished
medical professor and poet, Oliver Wendell
Holmes, in the <i>Boston Medical and Surgical Journal</i>,
August 16, 1855, from which we make a few extracts,
viz:</p>

<p>"Hardly any American physician was more widely
known to his countrymen, or more favorably considered
abroad, where his writings had carried his name. His
personal graces were known to a less extensive circle
of admiring friends.... To them it is easy to recall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
his ever-welcome and gracious presence. On his expanded
forehead no one could fail to trace the impress of a large
and calm intelligence.... A man so full of life will
rarely be found so gentle and quiet in all his ways....
The same qualities which fitted him for a public speaker
naturally gave him signal success as a teacher. Had he
possessed nothing but his clearness and eloquence of
language and elocution, he could hardly have failed to
find a popular welcome.... He had a manner at once
impressive and pleasing, a lucid order which kept the
attention and intelligence of the slowest hearer, and
attractions of a personal character always esteemed and
beloved by students.... Yet few suspected him of
giving utterance in rhythmical shape to his thoughts or
feelings. It was only when his failing limbs could bear
him no longer, as conscious existence slowly retreated
from the palsied nerves, that he revealed himself freely
in truest and tenderest form of expression. We knew
he was dying by slow degrees, and we heard from him
from time to time, or saw him always serene and always
hopeful while hope could have a place in his earthly
future ... when to the friends he loved there came,
as a farewell gift, ... a little book with a few songs
in it&mdash;songs with his whole warm heart in them&mdash;they
knew that his hour was come, and their tears fell fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
as they read the loving thoughts that he had clothed
in words of beauty and melody.</p>

<p>"Among the memorials of departed friendships we
treasure the little book of 'songs,' entitled <i>Simple Settings
in Verse for Six Portraits from Mr. Dickens' Gallery</i>,
Boston, 1855&mdash;his last present, as it was his last
production."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Doctor Lotan G. Watson</span>,</h4>

<p>Of North Carolina, filled the chair of Theory and Practice
in Transylvania in the sessions of 1844 and 1845
only. He came highly recommended as a physician of
extensive practice of not less than twenty years. "A
gentleman of undoubted talents. He has the reputation
of bringing to his cases a great affluence of resource and
fertility of expedient, regulated by a judgment discriminative
and safe. He writes with facility and elegance,

<h4><span class="smcap">Leonidas M. Lawson, M. D.</span>,</h4>

<p>Who filled the chair of General and Pathological Anatomy
and Physiology in the Medical Department of Transylvania
University from 1843 to 1846, inclusive, was born
in Nicholas County, Kentucky, September 10, 1812. He
had received his medical degree from this same department
of Transylvania in 1837.</p>

<p>He was engaged in Cincinnati in private practice,
giving clinical instruction in the hospital and editing his
recently established medical periodical, <i>The Western
Lancet</i>&mdash;of which he was sole originator and proprietor&mdash;when
he was called to the newly established chair
of General and Pathological Anatomy and Physiology in
the Transylvania Medical Department, in which he had
graduated.</p>

<p>Here he taught with great success until called to the
chair of Materia Medica and General Pathology in the
Ohio Medical College at Cincinnati in 1847. During the
vacation months of 1845, he spent seven months in a
visit to Europe, and especially in clinical studies in Guy's
Hospital, London, with great advantage to himself.</p>

<p>Doctor Lawson continued to teach from this chair
until the death of Professor J. P. Harrison, whom he
succeeded in that of the Principles and Practice of Medicine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and Clinical Medicine, in the same college in 1852.
He was appointed Professor of the Theory and Practice
of Medicine in the Kentucky School of Medicine in
Louisville in 1854, but accepted a call to the same chair
in the Medical College of Ohio, Cincinnati, in 1857. He
filled the chair of Clinical Medicine in the University of
Louisiana, New Orleans, in 1860, but returned in consequence
of the Civil War to the Medical College of Ohio
the following year, in which college he remained until
his death, January 21, 1864.</p>

<p>He founded the <i>Western Lancet</i>, and was its sole
editor and proprietor from 1842 up to the time of his
decease. He also edited <i>Hope's Morbid Anatomy</i>, 1844,
and published a treatise on the <i>Practical Treatment of
Phthisis Pulmonalis</i> in 1861.</p>

<p>Doctor Lawson was a lover of his profession and a
most indefatigable worker and student. Remarkably
lucid and impressive in his oral teachings, and methodical
in his laborious professional and editorial occupations,
he was a modest but self-possessed, undemonstrative
gentleman of high probity and personal merit. The
world at large did not fully appreciate his value, or that
of his labors.</p>

<p>His daughter, Miss Louisa Lawson, studied sculpture
as a profession, and as an artist is well known.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ethelbert Ludlow Dudley, M. D.</span>,</h4>

<p>Nephew of the late distinguished surgeon, Benjamin W.
Dudley, was his private pupil for many years. He graduated
in the Medical Department of Transylvania University
with distinguished honor in 1842, after having
attended three full courses of instruction in that department.
His first course of medical lectures was in the
winter of 1838&ndash;39. It was the first session in which the
present writer occupied the chair of Chemistry and Pharmacy,
and well he remembers the assiduous attention
of his pupil; his avidity in the acquisition of knowledge
and his unusual ability to retain it. Distrusting yet his
own attainments and desirous of more thorough training
before taking upon himself the responsible and arduous
offices of a practitioner, he, under the immediate charge
of his uncle, then in active practice, attended two other
full courses of medical lectures (sessions 1842&ndash;43 and
1843&ndash;44) as resident graduate. During this period he
sometimes officiated as prosector to his distinguished
kinsman.<a name="FNanchor_92_104" id="FNanchor_92_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_104" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Before the next following session, Doctor Ethelbert
L. Dudley was appointed Demonstrator of Anatomy in
the place of Doctor James M. Bush, who had been promoted
to the chair of Anatomy. This responsible office
he filled until called to the chair of General and Pathological
Anatomy in 1847&ndash;48.</p>

<p>From the origin of this medical school Professor Benjamin
W. Dudley had taught in the combined chair of
Anatomy and Surgery, blending the two in a manner
most instructive and practical.<a name="FNanchor_93_105" id="FNanchor_93_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_105" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> In 1837, he accepted
Doctor James M. Bush as adjunct to the combined professorship,
and in 1844, Doctor Bush having been
appointed Professor of Anatomy, the elder Dudley restricted
himself to the chair of the Principles of Surgery.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1846, Doctor Ethelbert L. Dudley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
was appointed to deliver a course of lectures on Comparative
Anatomy. This duty he performed to the highest
satisfaction of all concerned; and when, almost at
the beginning of the next regular session (1847&ndash;48), he
was called to the chair of Anatomy and Physiology, he
successfully encountered the great labor of preparing and
delivering a new course of lectures on these subjects.
At the same time he also discharged the arduous duties
of Demonstrator of Anatomy&mdash;duties more onerous in
this school, in our small inland city, than in most other
medical colleges. No one in the whole school accomplished
half the work which he mastered. No task
seemed too great for his young and ardent energies.</p>

<p>In 1849, he originated and took upon himself the sole
charge as editor of the <i>Transylvania Medical Journal</i>,
a new series of the old <i>Transylvania Journal of Medicine</i>.
He published three volumes in three successive
years, aided only occasionally by some of his colleagues.
In the spring of 1850, he visited Europe for professional
improvement, making many friends; amongst the distinguished
medical men of England particularly. Immediately
on his return from Europe, in the autumn of that
year, the present writer announced to him, in the city
of New York, his appointment to the chair of Descriptive
Anatomy and Histology in the Kentucky School of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Medicine. This was a new school which some of the
physicians of Louisville and professors of the Lexington
school were about to establish in the former city, to which
place students of medicine from the South and West were
beginning to flock, to the neglect somewhat of the time-honored
Transylvania school, in which it was proposed
to continue medical instruction in summer sessions.</p>

<p>This appointment he accepted, joining in the preliminary
October course of lectures and aiding greatly
by his talents and energy in building up that institution.
Transferred in the following year to the chair of
Surgery in the Transylvania summer school, on the retirement
of his uncle from active professional life, he continued
to teach with distinguished ability in the position
made illustrious by his predecessor, until the close of the
school shortly before the outbreak of our Civil War.</p>

<p>In the second year of the Kentucky School of Medicine,
he was transferred to the chair of Surgical Anatomy
and Operative Surgery, and accordingly gave the surgical-clinical
instruction in the Marine Hospital of Louisville
to the combined classes of the two medical schools of
that city during the session of 1851&ndash;52. A course which
was a decided success for the young professor and surgeon,
and which helped to place him at once on the elevated
position as a professional man and a gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
which he maintained to the day of his death and to
which few men, of his age especially, ever are fortunate
enough to attain.<a name="FNanchor_94_106" id="FNanchor_94_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_106" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>After another successful session in this school he,
with the other Transylvania professors, resigned and
returned permanently to Lexington, resuming his practice
there and his duties in the renewed winter sessions
of the Transylvania Medical Department.</p>

<p>As a practitioner, especially of surgery, Doctor E. L.
Dudley always commanded the highest respect and
admiration of his colleagues as well as the confidence
and affections of his patients. Singularly unselfish and
always willing to devote himself fully to his profession,
his patients and his friends, few men had the power so
quickly and so firmly to bind others to him with the ties
of affection.</p>

<p>With nerves as of steel, clear eye, quick judgment
and answering hand, combined with the kind
feelings of a woman and a fullness of professional
knowledge rarely surpassed, his short career as a
surgeon&mdash;all too brief!&mdash;was yet a brilliant one. Had
his life been spared to him the name of Dudley
had achieved a yet higher distinction in the annals
of surgery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>At the outbreak of our Civil War, Doctor Dudley's
loyal attachment to the nation and his love of country
caused him to take an active part against the rebellion.
While the fate of Kentucky hung yet in the balance of
a professed neutrality, he was actively instrumental in
organizing a battalion of "Home Guards," of which he
was at once appointed Commandant&mdash;an organization
which greatly helped to prevent the precipitation of our
State into the war for secession.<a name="FNanchor_95_107" id="FNanchor_95_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_107" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Obtaining authority to organize a regiment of volunteers
for active service, of which he was Colonel, preferring
this active position to the less belligerent one of
Medical Director which was proffered him, he left Lexington
with his command for the southern part of the
State. There, exhausted by the continued labors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
exposures of his combined offices of colonel, surgeon
and physician to his men (which he would not commit
to another), he fell a victim to typhoid fever on February
20, 1862, at the age of forty-four. His remains,
brought to Lexington, were received with public honors
and were followed to the cemetery by a long procession
of sorrowing friends.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Samuel Annan, M. D.</span>,</h4>

<p>Was born at Philadelphia, Pa., in the year 1800&mdash;a descendant
of Scotch ancestors. He graduated as M. D. at
the Edinburgh University in 1820. His thesis, entitled
<i>De Appoplexia Sanguinia</i>, is in the library of the Medical
and Surgical Faculty of Maryland. He was licentiate
of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland
in 1822, being then ex-President of the Royal Physical
Society of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>From 1827 to 1834, he ably occupied the chair of
Anatomy and Physiology in the Medical Department of
Washington University at Baltimore, Maryland. From
1838 to 1845, he was physician to the Baltimore Alms-house.
In 1846, he was called to the chair of Obstetrics
and Diseases of Women and Children in the Medical
Department of Transylvania University, a position which
he occupied with great ability until, in 1849, he was transferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
to the chair of Theory and Practice of
Medicine in the same institution, in which he gave
general satisfaction until 1854, when he resigned that
position.</p>

<p>During the years 1853&ndash;57, he was Superintendent to the
Insane Asylum at Hopkinsville, Kentucky. He became
surgeon to the Confederate States Army at the outbreak
of our Civil War in 1861, maintaining that position until
1864. In 1866, he was surgeon to the steamship "Carroll"
of the Liverpool line, from April to November. He
died at Baltimore, January 19, 1868.</p>

<p>Doctor Annan was a person of great activity of mind
and body, of high intelligence and probity of character.
In the course of his active life and practice in his profession
he found time to contribute many valuable articles
to the medical journals, of which we quote the following,
viz:</p>

the kindness of Doctor Oscar J. Coskery, of Baltimore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In 1850, Doctor Annan accepted the chair of
Pathology and Practice of Medicine in the new Kentucky
School of Medicine in Louisville, which position
he occupied for two years with great ability, when he
resigned to return to his native city.</p>

<p>In 1849, when Doctor Annan was transferred to the
chair of Theory and Practice, the chair of Obstetrics was
filled by Doctor William M. Boling, of Montgomery,
Alabama, for one session. Doctor Boling had taught in
the Memphis Medical School of Tennessee, and was
"favorably known in the South as a good practitioner,
an able medical writer, and an excellent teacher."</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Professor Henry M. Bullitt</span></h4>

<p>Occupied the chair of Materia Medica and Medical Botany
with ability during the session of 1849&ndash;50, after which,
with the aid of some of his Transylvania associates, he
established the "Kentucky School of Medicine," which
still maintains a prosperous condition.</p>

<p>"Doctor Bullitt commenced the study of medicine at
seventeen years of age, in the office of Doctor Coleman
Rogers, senior, of Louisville, entering the Medical Department
of the University of Pennsylvania as a pupil, and
graduating with high honor in 1838. Returning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Louisville, he began the practice of medicine in partnership
with Doctor Joshua B. Flint, thus continuing for
many years, their office being the headquarters of the
prominent physicians of this city.</p>

<p>"Doctor Bullitt passed the year 1845 in Europe, where
he took advantage of every opportunity of advancing
in medical knowledge. He returned liberally equipped
with the good fruits of his sojourn abroad. In 1846, he
was elected a professor in the St. Louis Medical College
and lectured there in 1846&ndash;47 and 1847&ndash;48. In 1849,
he was elected to the chair of Materia Medica, etc., in
Transylvania University.... In 1850, he was mainly
instrumental in the establishment of the Kentucky School
of Medicine in Louisville, aided by 'prominent members
of the Faculty of Transylvania.'</p>

<p>"In 1866, he was elected to the chair of Theory and
Practice in the University of Louisville, and, in 1867, was
transferred to that of Physiology. In 1868, he established
the Louisville Medical College, with which he
remained during the several years of his professional
life, his increasing deafness greatly marring his social and
professional enjoyments.</p>

<p>"Doctor Bullitt was an able writer on professional
subjects.... He held, successively, chairs in five medical
schools," in all with great ability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>"In 1866, he was elected Health Officer of the city
of Louisville," which office he most ably filled....
"Doctor Bullitt was one of the ablest Health Officers
the city ever possessed," and was author of many papers
of "great merit in numerous medical journals. His great
affliction, deafness, was all that prevented him from
taking the foremost position among medical practitioners,
teachers, and writers. But he bore the misfortune with
singular equanimity and fortitude."</p>

<p>Doctor Bullitt died on the seventh of January, 1880,
after a number of weeks' confinement to his bed with
Bright's disease.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The greater part of this brief sketch of the life of
Doctor Bullitt is copied from an able obituary notice
published in the <i>Louisville Journal</i> at the time of his
death.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Henry Martyn Skillman, M. D.</span>,</h4>

<p>Youngest child of Thomas T. and Elizabeth Farrar Skillman,
born September 4, 1824, at Lexington, Kentucky,
was educated in Transylvania University. He spent two
or three years in the drug and apothecary business in
Lexington, and commenced the study of medicine and
surgery in 1844, graduating as Doctor of Medicine, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
in 1847. He was appointed Demonstrator of Anatomy
in the Medical Department of Transylvania University
in 1848. In 1851, he was appointed Professor of General
and Pathological Anatomy and Physiology, which position
he occupied with skill and success until the close
of the Medical College in 1857. Since that time he has
devoted himself to the duties of his profession in medicine
and surgery, being "one of the most skillful, successful,
and accomplished physicians in Kentucky," and
"having inherited the admirable qualities of his parents,
is one of the most honorable and useful citizens of Lexington."<a name="FNanchor_96_108" id="FNanchor_96_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_108" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Since the above was written, the gentle and busy life
of this last surviving member of the Transylvania Medical
Faculty came suddenly to a close at his home in Lexington,
March 21, 1902, at a quarter past four o'clock in
the afternoon, apparently without warning. Only two
hours previously, handsome and smiling and dignified as
usual, he had visited a patient, and he expected in a few
hours to resume his professional rounds when the last
summons came.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

    <p class="caption">DOCTOR HENRY MARTYN SKILLMAN.<br />From a Photograph by Mullen.</p>
</div>

<p>It is hardly possible for a man to depart this life without
leaving an enemy, but if Doctor Skillman, in his fifty-four
years of active professional life, had made even a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
few enemies they hesitated to declare themselves. His
own nature was to see good in others; their defects were
not made prominent by him. As he spoke no evil, so
nothing but good was said of him. But with his amiable,
benevolent, compromising disposition there was no trace
of weakness. Strict in professional etiquette, immovable
in principle, he repelled with gentle but irresistible firmness
every effort to shake his integrity. The loveliness
of his character and personality is best portrayed in
"Luke, the Beloved Physician," a tribute paid, on his
death, editorially in the <i>Lexington Herald</i> by Kentucky's
favorite orator and statesman, every word of
which is as true as it is well-chosen and beautiful.
Doctor Skillman held numerous offices of trust; was
elected, in 1869, President of Kentucky State Medical
Society and, in 1889, the first President of Lexington
and Fayette County Medical Society, and was at the time
of his death the oldest practicing physician in Lexington,
having seen that city grow from eight thousand to thirty
thousand inhabitants. It is claimed that he was the
first physician to administer chloroform there. For two
years during the Civil War he was contract surgeon for
the Government.</p>

<p>Doctor Skillman's father, Thomas T. Skillman, a
native of New Jersey, came to Lexington in 1809, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
soon founded there the largest publishing house in the
Mississippi Valley, the name of T. T. Skillman on the
title page of a work being a guarantee of its excellence
and fitness for the family circle. In 1823, an edition of
several thousand copies of the entire Bible was published
by Mr. Skillman from stereotype plates sent from New
York by the American Bible Society. He founded the
<i>Evangelical Recorder and Western Review</i>, afterward
edited by Reverend John Breckinridge, the young and
talented pastor of "the McChord Church"; also the
<i>Western Luminary</i>, in 1824, the first religious paper
issued in the West.</p>

<p>Doctor Skillman married, October 30, 1851, Margaret,
daughter of Matthew T. Scott, President of the Northern
Bank of Kentucky. Of their children only one is living,
Henry Martyn Skillman, of the Lexington Security Trust
and Safety Vault Company.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Samuel M. Letcher, M. D.</span>,</h4>

<p>Of a prominent Kentucky family, also a graduate of the
Medical Department of Transylvania University who had
won distinction in his profession in Lexington, was called
to the chair of Professor of Obstetrics and Diseases of
Women and Children in that school in 1851, and performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the duties of that chair with ability and success
until the close of the Medical College in Lexington in
1857. During the Civil War he was placed in charge
of a United States General Hospital in Lexington, a position
which he held for some time, giving great satisfaction.
He died February 1, 1863, in Lexington, Kentucky.</p>

at Lexington,<a name="FNanchor_97_109" id="FNanchor_97_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_109" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Kentucky, and who first introduced there
the moral treatment of the insane instead of forcible
means, was appointed Professor of Materia Medica and
Botany in 1851, and performed the duties of this chair
with great ability until the end of the session of 1855,
when he resigned that position.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Doctor William Stout Chipley</span></h4>

<p>Was born in Lexington, Kentucky, October 18, 1810,
the only son of Reverend Stephen and Amelia Stout
Chipley, the forefathers of both of whom were pioneers
of Lexington. Doctor Chipley was graduated at Transylvania<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
in 1832, with marked honor. Not a great while
after his graduation he took issue with Doctor Benjamin
Dudley, the oldest and most renowned practitioner of
the State&mdash;or indeed of the whole country. Doctor
Dudley had published a treatise upon the treatment of
a special disease. Doctor Chipley took an opposite view,
expressing himself most boldly and brilliantly. His
article was published in an advanced medical journal
and copied widely. Chipley received widespread encomiums.
Indeed, he came off with raised banner, and his
colors have never since been furled. <a name="His" id="His"></a>His success was
progressive this article exemplifying his determination
when convinced he was right. Later he went to Columbus,
Georgia, feeling assured it was a fine opening for a
young practitioner, and so it proved. He was soon
launched into an almost phenomenal practice, extending
across the Chattahoochee River into Alabama to the
Indian nation, where his wonderful magnetism was felt
to such a degree that he won the confidence&mdash;even
friendship&mdash;of these savages. He would be detained
days at a time ministering to them&mdash;a tribe, too, by no
means regarded as friendly to the whites. In April,
1837, he married in Columbus, Georgia, Elizabeth Fanning,
niece and adopted daughter of Colonel James Fanning,
of Alamo fame. Doctor Chipley was at one time Mayor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of Columbus, and made a brilliant reputation as an executive
officer. At the entreaties of his mother and father,
who were quite advanced in age, he turned a deaf ear
to the opposition of his legion of friends in Columbus
and returned to Lexington, Kentucky, where it seemed
a flourishing practice did but await him. He was a very
successful Professor of Transylvania in the chair of Theory
and Practice of Medicine, from 1854 to 1857, inclusive.
As a lecturer he had a wonderful flow of language. The
possessor of a perfect voice and delivery, he chained the
attention of all listeners. Often have I heard his patients
say his sunshiny presence, his gentle, sympathetic touch
in the sick-room, dulled pain and was better than drugs.
He was a brilliant and forceful writer, the author of
many medical works and the writer of numerous articles
published in medical journals of the highest note. One
small book of his gave him much notoriety. Chief Justice
George Robertson, of Lexington, regarded it of such
high worth that he gave fifteen hundred dollars to have
it published and placed as a healthful guide in certain
schools for boys. It was in 1855 that he took charge of
the Eastern Kentucky Lunatic Asylum at Lexington.
This proved a wide field for the development of the most
astonishing tact and management of individuals. The
attendants greatly admired him and yielded without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
question to his dictation. Gentle as a woman, adamantine
after a decision, never acting hastily, maturing a
subject before deciding&mdash;these characteristics were shown
on all occasions where it pertained to the comfort of the
poor creatures under his care. During his fifteen or
sixteen years of most successful management of this
institution, he made many radical changes for the amelioration
of the condition of these unfortunates. Winter
after winter he haunted the legislative halls in behalf
of the Asylum, spending his own personal means most
lavishly to meet this end&mdash;presenting one bill after
another, which sooner or later were always honored. His
enthusiasm and faithfulness carried conviction with them.
When he took charge of the Asylum he found it a conglomerate
mass&mdash;many from other States there&mdash;incurables,
epileptics, idiots&mdash;all huddled together. He went
carefully over the records and proceeded to institute a
thorough weeding. First he notified the governors of
the respective States to send for their own insane, giving
them a stated time of grace, and telling them that if the
call was not honored he would send the patients to their
doors by one of his own attendants, which he did in
several instances. This systematizing was a great step
forward. The next thing he did was to induce the State
to erect an institution for idiots, believing there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
few born who were not capable of receiving some degree
of cultivation. In time a home was built at Frankfort,
the result proving his great wisdom. It was a matter
of wonderment to see these poor creatures developing
from a driveling state of nonentity into some capacity
for the enjoyment of life, and even to a degree of usefulness.
There were but few incapable of being taught
some employment which rendered their life more than
a mere existence, akin alone to the lower animals. To
have succeeded in this was enough to mark any man's
life. His philanthropy never slept. Then, through his
direct intervention, the Asylum at Anchorage for incurables
was erected; all these changes making room for
those who stood a chance of being cured instead of their
being turned, for the lack of room, from the sheltering
care which might restore them. I think his influence
was brought to bear upon the advisability of an institution
for the deaf and dumb, which culminated in the
home made for them in Danville. I think it was in or
about the year 1857 he went to Europe, absolutely for
the purpose of gaining an insight into better ways and
means of the treatment of the insane and the construction
of the buildings which were their homes. Though
there was such an emptying of the old Eastern Kentucky
Lunatic Asylum building, it soon became altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
insufficient to meet the demands. Applications poured
in, and soon, after a hard-fought battle, the legislature
made an appropriation to add to the old building, and
promptly there was under construction a building which,
when finished, for comfort and in a sanitary way was
unequaled. This, years after his death, was destroyed
by fire, and when rebuilt, I understand, was modeled
after the old plan. He was his own architect, his whole
heart and being merged in a desire to have all as nearly
perfect as possible, developing thus a new talent. He
always had in view a private asylum of his own. This
purpose was crystallized when it became apparent that
politics would govern the State institutions, though in
opposition to all that was humane. He resigned December,
1869. He purchased "Duncannon," the beautiful
Duncan home near Lexington. The site selected, lumber
on the place, all plans formulated, having gained such
advanced ideas from his long and successful experience
he hoped to have an ideal shelter for those who preferred
private treatment. On December 9, 1871, at eleven
o'clock at night, snow on the ground, standing with his
family and several whom even then he had under his
charge around him, after barely escaping with their lives,
he saw the "Duncannon" mansion reduced to ashes.
This disaster crippled his efforts to the degree that he
was forced to forego that which if carried through would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
have proven a monument to his memory of no small
magnitude. He then rented a house in Lexington, where
he had some patients under his charge, with a private
attendant who had won many laurels in this capacity.
Doctor Chipley was frequently called upon, even in other
States, to decide in the courts as a specialist in insanity.
He had a great number under his private treatment in
their own homes, of whom the world never knew. He
had innumerable offers of positions, but none seemed to
appeal to him so much as one at College Hill, near Cincinnati,
Ohio. He accepted this offer. His success here
proved a very decided one, redeeming the institution
from great financial stress and opening up astonishing
possibilities. He had four sons&mdash;only one now living
(1903)&mdash;and one daughter (the present writer). He left
many friends in Lexington who were ever beckoning
him back, and to the last he hoped to return where his
heart was. But after only a few years of service at College
Hill he contracted a cold from which he never recovered.
He died February 11, 1880. Invitations had been
issued for a reunion in honor of his aged mother, who
was ninety-seven the day he died. A train was to be
chartered and Lexington friends were to come. He has
left a memory of his gathered laurels and honored name
more precious than the gems of the universe.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Doctor James Morrison Bruce</span></h4>

<p>Was a son<a name="FNanchor_98_110" id="FNanchor_98_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_110" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> of John Bruce, a Scottish gentleman associated
with Colonel James Morrison and Benjamin Gratz in the
manufacture of hemp at Lexington, Kentucky, and was
born at that place in 1822. After completing a collegiate
education, he studied medicine with Doctor Benjamin
W. Dudley, taking the degree of M. D. in Transylvania
in 1843. He then spent three years in France, studying
in the principal hospitals at Paris under the most eminent
instructors. In 1846, he returned to Lexington to
begin the practice of his profession. He was elected to
the chair of Demonstrator of Anatomy in Transylvania
Medical Department in 1850, continuing therein until
the cessation of the school in 1857. Doctor Bruce's
intrinsic merit was fully appreciated by his colleagues,
who had great affection for him, but his excessively
shrinking nature withheld him from taking the prominent
position with the public to which his ability and learning
entitled him. In truth, his chief characteristic was
his modest, amiable, and retiring disposition. His
specialty in medicine was eruptive disease. In the treatment
of smallpox his professional brethren conceded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
him the highest place. For many years he was continuously
elected City Physician, and holding this office he
died, January 31, 1881, the sudden ending of his useful
and kindly life being largely due to the exposure he so
constantly and bravely encountered in his visits to the
suffering poor during an unusually severe and trying
winter. Says a fellow-physician,<a name="FNanchor_99_111" id="FNanchor_99_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_111" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> "It was then that the
great and good qualities of our friend and co-laborer,
Doctor Bruce, shone pre-eminently. It was at a time
when poverty and distress appealed to him that his great-heartedness,
his forgetfulness of self, and his proficient
medical skill forced itself before that public attention
from which at all other times it timidly shrunk." Doctor
Bruce married, in 1847, Miss Elizabeth Norton. Of his
children Miss Elizabeth Bruce and Mrs. Charlotte B.
Davis, of Lexington, survive him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>From 1850 until the end in 1857, the existence of the
school seems to have been an heroic struggle against
fate. In spite of the fine Medical Hall, alluded to on the
day of its dedication (November 2, 1840) by President
Robert Davidson,<a name="FNanchor_101_113" id="FNanchor_101_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_113" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> as "colossal in size and surpassing
in architectural beauty," in spite of liberal endowments
and "costly and complete apparatus, superior to any
in the valley of the Mississippi, and not surpassed, if
equaled, by any on the continent,"<a name="FNanchor_102_114" id="FNanchor_102_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_114" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> the school languished.
Notwithstanding the efforts of zealous Trustees
and generous citizens, notwithstanding the diligence of an
able Faculty, the classes steadily decreased from year to
year until, in 1857, with only nine graduates, the Faculty
in despair disbanded, and the time-honored Medical
Department of Transylvania University was no more.</p>

<p>Two factors more than all else (except as before mentioned,
the impossibility of securing sufficient material
for clinical instruction) had contributed to its demise&mdash;the
retirement of Doctor Dudley in 1850, and the difficulty
that existed in establishing the needed railroads
throughout the State. The latter cause had been operating
unfavorably and with increasing effect almost ever
since the introduction of steam transportation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>Enlightened thinkers had early recognized and urged
the vital importance of railroads for Kentucky, and
especially for Lexington and Transylvania, and had
bravely advanced to conquer the difficulties of the situation,
but with only discouragement and pecuniary loss
for many years. The peculiar topography of the State,
the constant alternation of hill and valley, the numerous
streams, the hardness of the rock to be penetrated, made
the building of railways very expensive, and capital was
wanting. The wealth of Central Kentucky was in the
soil, not in the purse, and without communication with
the markets of the world this wealth was unavailable.
In this manner enterprise was checked and Lexington
sank into an apathetic state. It is true she had secured
the distinction of having the first railroad in the West
and the second in the United States,<a name="FNanchor_103_115" id="FNanchor_103_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_115" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> but for years it
only led to Frankfort, an interior town but twenty-eight
miles distant. It was not until 1851 that it connected
with Louisville.</p>

<p>Of Doctor Dudley's influence upon the medical school
Doctor David W. Yandell truly says:<a name="FNanchor_104_116" id="FNanchor_104_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_116" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> "The history of
the Medical Department of Transylvania University&mdash;its
rise, its success, its decline, its disappearance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the list of medical colleges&mdash;would practically cover
Doctor Dudley's career, and would form a most interesting
chapter in the development of medical teaching in
the Southwest. But it must suffice me here to say that
Doctor Dudley created the medical department of the
institution and directed its policy. Its students regarded
him from the beginning as the foremost man in the
Faculty. That he had colleagues whose mental endowments
were superior to his he himself at all times freely
admitted. He is said to have laid no claim to either
oratorical power or professional erudition. He was not
a logician, he was not brilliant, and his deliverances were
spiced with neither humor nor wit. And yet, says one
of his biographers, in ability to enchain the students'
attention, to impress them with the value of his instructions
and his greatness as a teacher, he bore off the palm
from all the gifted men who at various periods taught
at his side."</p>

<p>But although these two would appear to be the more
obvious reasons for the decline of the Medical Department
of Transylvania, we can by no means ignore the
injurious effect of rival medical colleges growing up at
points more accessible and more progressive than Lexington
could possibly be without rapid transit of some
sort to make her own peculiar advantages available.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Nor can we overlook the evil consequences of the opposition
systematically shown to the Transylvania Medical
School by the faction originating in the attempt to disorganize
the institution in 1837.</p>

<p>However, in reviewing all these influences, the prosperity
of Lexington to-day (1904), her rapid growth, her
increasing enterprise, her vigorous trade, the flourishing
condition of her colleges and seminaries&mdash;all of which has
come to her since the completion of the railroads centering
in her&mdash;abundantly prove that this communication,
above everything else, was her indispensable requirement.</p>

<p>While the medical school was closed in 1857, the
Academical Department of Transylvania University continued
to be conducted at the Morrison College as a State
Normal School,<a name="FNanchor_105_117" id="FNanchor_105_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_117" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> under the Presidency of the distinguished
Doctor Lewis W. Green, D. D., but was soon to be disorganized,
after only two years of usefulness, on account
of a supposed unconstitutionality. Thus Transylvania
was again humbled to a low estate in educational distinction.
Lexington herself was suffering an era of banishment,
as we may say, for without proper railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
connections she was excluded from progress and rendered
inaccessible to both labor and capital. The financial
prosperity of her citizens was not such as to warrant
the lavish hospitality formerly shown to strangers within
her gates, and especially to the students in Transylvania.
The enterprising individuals who remained to her were
not sufficient in numbers to dispel by their most strenuous
exertions the lethargy which had fallen upon the
place.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs immediately preceding
the Civil War. The immense Medical Hall had reverted
to the city and was deserted, save the laboratory in which
was still being busily conducted the chemical work of
the first Geological Survey of Kentucky; and save perhaps
one of the smaller rooms, rented to a lodger. The
survey had just received a sudden check in the death
of the lamented Doctor Owen when the war still further
darkened the prospect, during which, as a matter of
course, the resumption of the survey was out of the question.
The Morrison College was almost immediately
appropriated by the United States Government for a
general hospital, and, some time after, the Medical Hall,
which as before mentioned was utterly destroyed by
fire<a name="FNanchor_106_118" id="FNanchor_106_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_118" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> during its occupation by the sick soldiers. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
conflagration originated, it appeared, from a defective
flue of a temporary frame kitchen, built adjoining.<a name="FNanchor_107_119" id="FNanchor_107_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_119" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The corner-stone of this Medical Hall had been laid
July 4, 1839; Robert Wickliffe, junior, the well-beloved,
making the address. It was dedicated November 2, 1840.
Of Grecian architecture, massive and without ornamentation,
it contained three great lecture rooms, with ample
provision for light and ventilation. The amphitheatre
was immediately below the cupola, being by this means
lighted from above. There were three other large apartments&mdash;for
the library, the anatomical museum, and for
other medical teaching. Smaller rooms accommodated
the laboratory, Faculty room, janitor's room, etc. Besides
which were long halls or galleries utilized for natural
history collections, museums of zoology, ornithology,
geology, etc., as also for apparatus of divers sorts. The
costly and complete chemical apparatus was well displayed
and conveniently arranged in the immense lecture
room for that department.</p>

    <p class="caption">ABSOLOM DRIVER.<br />For many years Janitor at the Medical Hall of Transylvania University.</p>
</div>

<p>In the spacious lecture-room in the front of the building
many fashionable and distinguished audiences had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
assembled on various occasions, not only to hear the
gifted incumbent professors in due discourse of introductory
or valedictory, but to be charmed with concerts
by Ole Bull, Strakosch, Adelina Patti&mdash;who sang there
on her first tour in this country&mdash;and other celebrities
of the period. There the learned Guyot had instructed in
geology; there unique "Tom Marshall" had uniquely
delivered a unique course of lectures on History. Over
the rostrum hung the portrait of Doctor Samuel Brown&mdash;the
first medical professor. This lecture hall was
lighted for evening assemblages, from the sides mostly, by
"scounches," as they were called by the "ole Virginny"
negro janitor. This factotum, "Absolom Driver," is unforgotten
by any whose path some time ran parallel with
his. For many years the keeper of the Medical Hall,
his zeal and vigilance were unimpeachable, his dignified
solemnity on state occasions unsurpassed. Contemptuous
of letters&mdash;except for doctors&mdash;and with unshakable prejudice
against "book learnin' for niggers," he was faithful
in trusts with the matchless fidelity of the dog. "Bad
boys"&mdash;the problem of philosophers and ordinary folk
in all ages&mdash;was one of easy solution by "Uncle Absolom"
with a bent nail at the end of a long pole. Charged upon
with <i>elan</i> with this unprecedented weapon, accompanied
by an ominous war-cry, no truant could withstand, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
though the artfully strewn broken bottles on the high
back fence had been successfully outflanked. "Robbers"
had their everlasting antidote at hand in the peculiarly
uncanny, long, "one-barreled shotgun" with curious
lock, which stood in the corner of the Faculty room. Nobody
ever heard it "go off," but the mystery of it was
what appalled one. Happily "Uncle Absolom's" death
was nearly coeval with the closing of the medical school.
To have witnessed the burning of his sacred temple, the
Medical Hall, after all his "keer," would have broken
his heart indeed.</p>

<p>And now, bidding adieu to the shades of the grand
old Transylvania Medical Department, conjured from the
past by one now numbered with them, may the earnest
wish be permitted with hope of realization, that some
other hand with cunning in such craft will unveil to us
the portraits of that bygone throng of brilliant men
which constituted and which were the exponents of the
honored Transylvania Law School.</p>

<p>Thus the records show that in thirty-nine years of the existence of the Medical
Department of Transylvania University it taught six thousand four hundred and
fifty-six pupils and conferred the degree of Doctor of Medicine on one thousand
eight hundred and eighty-one of that number. The late Professor Thomas D.
Mitchell, in speaking of its record, made the following remark: "That for its vigorous
prosperity and the rapid increase of its classes, the medical school of Transylvania
is without a parallel. Certainly in the United States there is nothing
comparable to it. This is the highest eulogy the institution can receive. The
most eloquent and forcible language in praise of it would be spiritless and feeble
contrasted with the power of the foregoing figures."</p>

<span class="label">[4]</span></a> An interesting notice of "<i>Inoculation for Smallpox</i>," in 1794, is to be found
in the files of the old <i>Kentucky Gazette</i>, a paper published by John Bradford, in
Lexington, August 11, 1787&mdash;the first newspaper published west of the Alleghany
mountains. This notice appeared in that paper January 4, 1794, as follows: "On
Thursday last the inhabitants of this place began the inoculation of smallpox and
have agreed to continue until the fifteenth, after which they are determined to
cease. They have appointed a committee to draw up a remonstrance to the court
of Fayette County requesting that the order of that court granting liberty to the
inhabitants of said county to inoculate may be rescinded, so far as respects the
town of Lexington, after that date." The <i>Gazette</i> for the first of February
following has this significant statement, illustrating the great hazard of this primitive
operation, viz: "That the smallpox had been very fatal within the three weeks
past in the town and vicinity under inoculation, that at least <i>one out of fifteen died</i>
who had been inoculated, and very few children had recovered." Vaccination
was introduced here by Professor Samuel Brown, M. D., at quite an early period,
as we shall see further on.</p>

<span class="label">[23]</span></a> His great niece, Mrs. Waller O. Bullock, in speaking of the portrait of Doctor
Overton, the only one extant, says: "It was done in Philadelphia just as he was
completing his medical course, and I think it must have been soon after that he
entered upon his work at Transylvania. He took a post-graduate course at Paris,
France, and was considered one of the most brilliant men of his day. He had
great command of language and his conversation sparkled with wit and humor,
nor was he less happy with his pen. On one occasion the city of Nashville offered
a handsome prize for the best essay on some disputed medical point; no one was
barred; doctors of all ages entered the lists, and Uncle James&mdash;though an old
man&mdash;bore off the honors. In cultivated elegant society he was at his best, and
when distinguished foreigners visited President Jackson at the Hermitage it always
devolved on Doctor Overton to do the agreeable, his command of French peculiarly
fitting him for this post. He early left Kentucky to make his home in Tennessee,
where he practiced his profession for many years, dying at an advanced
age."</p>

for the purpose on Main Street. At the time of the reorganization in 1819 a commodious
apartment in the upper story of the large building (on Short Street) now
occupied (1854) by the Branch Bank of Kentucky, then as a tavern, was temporarily
fitted up as a lecture-room, and Doctor Dudley lectured in his own rooms
back of his office ... (on Mill Street, east side, a little above Church Street). The
rapid increase of the class soon induced Doctor Dudley to enlarge his accommodation
by the erection of a very commodious amphitheatre, in which he lectured
until 1839&ndash;40, when the new hall was built (corner of Broadway and Second)."

<span class="label">[26]</span></a> Doctor C. C. Graham relates, in reference to student life about this time:
"Dead bodies at that day were not articles of commerce, so we, the students, had
to disinter them; and we once had a battle, so published in the newspapers, at
the old Baptist graveyard&mdash;the Battle of the Graveyard, so-called&mdash;when taking
up the Irishman that caused the duel (between Dudley and Richardson). We were
taken prisoners by an armed guard and hauled up to the court-house for trial, but
there was no law to make the dead private property, so the declaration of Scripture
that from dust we came and unto dust we must return let us off by paying
one cent damages for taking that much clay or soil. At another time, near Nicholasville,
we were pursued when making our way to our horses hitched outside
an orchard fence, and one ball of several fired lodged in the subject, on my back."

<p>"It is believed from this view of it that for its vigorous prosperity and the
rapid increase of its classes, the Medical School of Transylvania is without a parallel.
Certainly in the United States there is nothing comparable to it. At the commencement
of the present century, when the Medical School of Philadelphia had
been in operation about forty years, it did not number more, we believe, than 200
pupils. It now contains about 400&mdash;rumor says a few more. In <i>thirty-three</i> years,
then, that school has added about 200 to its classes, while <i>in less than half that
time</i> the school of Transylvania has <i>formed</i> a class of 262. This is the highest
eulogy the institution can receive." (Doctor Caldwell to Lexington Medical
Society, 1834, "On the Impolicy of Multiplying Schools of Medicine.")</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_46_58" id="Footnote_46_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_58">
<span class="label">[46]</span></a> At the time of the formation of the "Transylvania Institute" (February 20,
1839), under articles of agreement between the city of Lexington and the Trustees
of Transylvania University (see Deed Book No. 17, Page 42, office Fayette County
Court), the city endowed the University with seventy thousand dollars; forty-five
thousand dollars was to build a new medical hall and provide additional library
and apparatus for the same, five thousand dollars for the Law Department, and
twenty thousand dollars for Morrison College, securing permanent scholarships in
each college. In consequence of a want of harmony in the Board of Trustees as
to the location of the proposed medical hall, the medical professors and their friends
felt obliged to purchase a lot (corner of Broadway and Second Street, where Doctor
Bush's residence was afterward built) at a cost of five thousand dollars, although
there was abundant space on the University grounds. This lot, to purchase which
citizens contributed three thousand dollars of the five thousand, was given in trust
to the University&mdash;but, by an unauthorized clause in the deed of conveyance, the
lot and the medical hall erected on it at a cost of about thirty-five thousand dollars
reverted to the city about 1860. On this building, which was burned during the
Civil War, the medical professors also paid out of their own incomes the surplus
cost over thirty thousand dollars which had been provided by the city. The medical
professors also each contributed annually to the medical library, etc., ten dollars.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_47_59" id="Footnote_47_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_59">
<span class="label">[47]</span></a> There remain of this library five thousand, six hundred and eighty-four
volumes; pamphlets and medical journals, seven hundred and fifty-four; bound
volumes of theses, one hundred and thirty-eight, at Kentucky University.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_48_60" id="Footnote_48_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_60">
<span class="label">[48]</span></a> In the session following this disintegration of the school Doctor Thomas D.
Mitchell says, in his Historical Catalogue of the Medical School, 1838: "Notwithstanding
the great pecuniary embarrassments of the country and the peculiar
circumstances accompanying the late disorganization, the number of pupils fell
short but fifteen of the previous session."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_49_61" id="Footnote_49_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_61">
<span class="label">[49]</span></a> Doctor Mitchell at this time says: "The entire course of lectures in this
school costs the sum of <i>one hundred and five dollars</i>. In addition the matriculation
fee, which entitles the pupil to use of the very extensive library, is <i>five dollars</i>. The
dissecting ticket is <i>ten dollars</i>, and may be taken or omitted at pleasure." The
qualifications for candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine: "The persons
offering must be 21 years of age and must have been engaged in the study of medicine
during three years. Two full courses of lectures in a chartered medical school
(the last of which in this institution) are also requisite. But persons who exhibit
satisfactory proof of having been engaged in reputable practice for the space of
four years may be candidates by attending one course of lectures, which must be
in this school. Each candidate is required to exhibit all his tickets to the Dean
before his name can be enrolled. The fee for graduation is $20." (See Doctor
Mitchell's Historical Catalogue, 1838.)</p>

Cooke was one of the few men who might have been safely trusted to write his
autobiography. He would have reviewed his career with a truthfulness, a modesty,
a candor that would have exalted his character in the eyes of men. His works will

by the earnest student."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_56_68" id="Footnote_56_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_68">
<span class="label">[56]</span></a> Professor Henry Miller, of Louisville, says of Doctor Short: "As a lecturer
Dr. Short's style was chaste, concise, and classical, and his manner always grave
and dignified. His lectures were always carefully and fully written and read in
the lecture room with a good voice and correct emphasis. He never made the
least attempt at display nor set a clap-trap in all his life."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_57_69" id="Footnote_57_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_69">
<span class="label">[57]</span></a> Doctor Gross says: "In stature Dr. Short was of medium height, well proportioned,
with light hair and complexion, blue eyes, and an ample forehead. His
features when lighted up by a smile were radiant with goodness and beneficence.
In manner he was graceful, calm, and dignified; so much so that one coming into
his presence for the first time might have supposed him to be haughty and ascetic;
such, however, was not the case."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_58_70" id="Footnote_58_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_70">
<span class="label">[58]</span></a> Doctor David W. Yandell thus writes of Doctor Short as connected with the
Medical Institute of Louisville: "Dr. Short was a most valuable officer. His
high scientific attainment, the soundness of his judgment, high dignity and urbanity
of manner, his amiable temper and blameless life added character and weight to
the institution. Botany was his favorite pursuit. He found the flora of this
region (Louisville) virgin and unknown, and so collected, arranged, and classified
it that his successors in this field have been able to change nothing and to add but
little to his work."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_59_71" id="Footnote_59_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_71">
<span class="label">[59]</span></a> We see in the records of the Trustees of Transylvania University that on
March 17, 1832, Doctor Short was elected President <i>pro tem.</i> of Transylvania
University "during the pleasure of the Board," but there is no mention of his
acceptance. The fact is, Professors Short, Caldwell, and Dudley acted alternately
as President <i>pro tem.</i> on public occasions and in signing diplomas, etc., until a
President could be elected. The Reverend B. O. Peers was inaugurated President
<i>pro tem.</i>, 1833, and the Reverend Thomas W. Coit, an eminent Episcopalian divine
from New England, was installed as President in 1835.</p>

several powerful galvanic batteries and a fine collection of apparatus recently

been before." (Historical Catalogue, 1838.)</p>

<span class="label">[66]</span></a> Of the books, apparatus, etc., purchased in Europe by Doctor Peter we find

anatomy and surgery, one thousand five hundred dollars; models for obstetrics,
five hundred dollars; specimens for materia medica and therapeutics and drawing,

to any in the United States." (Introductory lecture of Doctor Peter to Medical

<span class="label">[73]</span></a> Doctor Owen says: "The principal operating room in which Dr. P. made his
analyses is 15 feet square, the working and balance tables stand within three feet
of each other, and the furnace, sand, and water baths three feet from the former,
so that one or two steps suffice to reach all important parts of the different operations
in their various stages of progression. The reagents constantly in use ...
in a case resting on the working table within arm's reach of the operator, and his
recording desk in a drawer of the same table." This laboratory was in the north-west
corner of the Medical Hall, corner of Broadway and Second Street. Doctor
Owen, zealous to defend Doctor Peter, explains further that the latter was aided
by a more than common physical as well as mental aptitude. Doctor Peter took
no part in this defense save to extend to the skeptics an invitation to visit his laboratory
and examine his manner of working.</p>

<span class="label">[74]</span></a> I must acknowledge that the expression "shoulder to shoulder" is a mere
figure of speech as regards "Uncle Davy" Sayre, for he usually attended the
drills in a buggy in subservience to his gout, being thereby rendered immune from
the consequences suffered by his dignified compatriots of sundry knots tied, by
youthful humorists, in the long grass of the classic "little college lot," the favorite
drill ground of the Home Guard, as it had been of Morgan's Rifles and other military
companies. This "college lot" was none other than the original "out lot
No. 6," the first seat of Transylvania, and was the identical spot whereon had
taught the immortal Holley. Madison C. Johnson was "conspicuous" for his
sky-blue blouse of fine material, which stood forth in the ranks of common dark
blue cotton, and must have been a mark for the enemy had the celebrated battle
for the arms hereinafter mentioned ever taken place.</p>

<span class="label">[77]</span></a> In the heat of contest Doctor Peter's adversaries did not hesitate to call him
an infidel and an atheist. It was the worst they could say, but not strictly in
conformity with the facts. He was not a church member. He had been baptized
in the Church of England, always kept a pew in the Episcopal Church, and as a
young man taught in the Episcopal Sunday-school. The spectacle, in so many
instances, of the impediment to educational progress by narrowness and bigotry
in churches had given him an indifference&mdash;not disguised&mdash;to <i>sectarian</i> religion.
He never molested the religious tenets of others. He constantly declared that
education should be free to <i>all</i> men, irrespective of creed.</p>

<span class="label">[78]</span></a> Antagonists in this controversy, powerless to assail him as a scientist and
teacher, characterized him as a person of low origin and brutal manners. He
ignored this attack, it being his custom never to lean upon ancestors&mdash;to look
forward rather than back, holding to the homely but truly American saying that
"every tub must stand on its own bottom." But in truth he was of excellent
English family and a descendant of that powerful "Arundel" who in the days of
the Conquest was master of twenty-eight lordships. His manners passed muster
among old-fashioned Kentucky gentlemen.</p>

graduated in 1812. In 1813 was appointed by the Governor of Pa. to the office
of Lazaretto Physician of the Port of Phila, which post I held until 1816, when
indisposition compelled me to resign. I then had opportunity of becoming
acquainted with the Southern fevers, particularly the yellow fever of N. Orleans and
the West Indies. For 17 years after I was actively engaged in practice, and may
refer to Eberle's <i>Therapeutics</i> for his opinion of me as a medical man, at a time
when I was not personally acquainted with him. The journals of those times
contain many medical papers furnished by me, as examination will show. In 1831
my name was before the Trustees of Jefferson Medical College for the chair of
Materia Medica vacated by the resignation of Dr. Eberle, and I would have been
appointed, as I have since been informed by Gen. Duncan, one of the Trustees, if
I had not agreed to join with Dr. Eberle a new faculty at Cincinnati. If any
object that a Prof'r of Chemistry can not make a good Prof'r of Theory and Practice,
I have only to refer to the case of the celebrated Dr. Rush, who passed directly
from Chemistry to Theory and Practice, as the published records of the University
of Penna. will show."</p>

<span class="label">[83]</span></a> Doctor Mitchell was an exceedingly rapid speaker. With difficulty could
those unused to this peculiarity follow his swift flow of language and ideas. But
once accustomed, his pupils liked this better than the more deliberate speech of
other professors. He never failed to impress upon students the importance of
a not too hasty diagnosis, the <i>premonitory</i> symptoms of widely differing diseases
being nearly identical; whereas treatment proper for one disease might result
fatally if applied to another.</p>

secure. Its friends may, without fear of contradiction, pronounce it to be decidedly
the best endowed medical school in America. Its patronage and the emoluments

resignation can not exercise the least injurious influence upon <a name="its" id="its"></a>its prosperity. The

<p>Letter to Doctor Smith from the Faculty: "Dear Sir: The receipt of your
communication informing us that circumstances beyond your control would oblige
you to resign the chair of the Theory and Practice of Medicine in the Medical Department
of Transylvania University at the end of the present session, renders some
expression of sentiment on our part both just and appropriate. Permit us, therefore,
to assure you that we receive the information of your intended resignation
with regret, and that nothing would have afforded us more gratification than the
certainty of your continuance among us as a fellow-citizen and colleague. The
intercourse which has existed between us for the three years during which we have
been associated has been of the most harmonious and pleasant character, and the
ability with which you have performed the duties of your chair increases the reluctance
with which we give up the expectations of a longer co-operation with you
under the auspices of Transylvania University. With the most sincere wishes for
your continued increase in fame and prosperity, we remain your friends and colleagues.</p>

<span class="label">[95]</span></a> An incident well told by his son-in-law, General Joseph C. Breckinridge, is
characteristic of Dudley. When, during the Civil War, a struggle was imminent
between the secessionists and the Home Guard for possession of a large shipment
of arms and ammunition sent into Kentucky by the United States Government
for the arming of Union soldiers and citizens, Dudley, fearing the Home Guard
at Lexington would be overpowered and the munitions captured on arrival, sent
as a trusty messenger to General Nelson, at Camp Dick Robinson, to ask for troops&mdash;a
midnight journey of twenty miles through a hostile country&mdash;his only son,
Scott Dudley, a youth scarcely seventeen. He saddled the horse and armed the
boy himself, at dead of night, the better to insure secrecy, for in his own household
were foes. This mission was successful. (See speech of General Joseph C.
Breckinridge, United States Army, at the reunion of the Army of the Cumberland,
Chattanooga, October 10, 1900.) Ensign J. Cabell Breckinridge, United
States Navy, the first life lost on the threshold of the Spanish War, and Lieutenant
Ethelbert D. Breckinridge, seriously wounded almost at the very instant that his
General, the well-beloved Lawton, fell beside him in the Philippines, were grandsons
of Doctor Dudley.</p>
